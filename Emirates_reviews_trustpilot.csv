I was surprised when I was charged over 100 pounds just to choose seats. When there are 4 people, this becomes very expensive. Other carriers such as Singapore don't charge. Also the Boeing 777s in the fleet are terrible, absolutely no room on them and a really uncomfortable long haul experience."
1,"Excellent in-flight service and really good helping people with limited mobility. I was travelling with sprained foot and they were good not only to pick me up, let me know what's next but also spoke good English and were very helpful."
2,My mom flew from Heathrow to Dubai on Friday 25th November 2022 on flight EK096 which was scheduled for 22:00 but unfortunately due to some problems it departed at 23:30 but Emotates Authorities did not bother about passengers to serve them dome food or refreshments while the flight wasn't boarding n which is not a very good sign of service n is a disgrace n disappointment thing.So I will make sure that  me or any of my family members or relatives do not fly from Emirates at all unless they imptheir services.
3,I have back problems so I take my own pillow on the plane. A tempur. I happened to forget it on the plane. When I called this morning they confirmed it is not in the lost and found!!! Why do Emirates not check the plane for forgotten items before allowing the cleaners on the plane!!
4,My flight from Dubai to Birmingham on March 25th 2020 was cancelled because of Covid. The booking was made through Opodo who will not refund me because they say Emirates have not refunded them. I thought Emirates were better this!
5,"I live in Australia and frequently travel overseas. One of very rude/disresctful Emirates  staff member in Lahore Pakistan weighed my laptop bag and fined me PKR Rs.23390/-. He was not providing me proper information and was not even willing to talk to me or guide me. I travelled in 3-countries over the period of 3-weeks using Emirates airline and no one weighed my laptop bag except for this unprofessional Emirates staff member who weighed my laptop bag. I travel frequently and this has happened for the first time that I was charged extra money to bring my laptop bag. None of the other airlines (Quantas, JetStar, Thai Airways, Malaysia Air, Oman Air, Etihad Air, Qatar Airways). Even Emirates airline did this only on this occasion or may be it was just this unprofessional staff member"
6,"Reserved Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Dhaka via Dubai. Booked economy Seat From LGW/DXB -Paid Upper Deck Seat . Dubai Dhaka Business Class. Reported at check in desk on time . Double check with counter that , when will get Wheelchair . The lady from counter replied that, not possible  to provide wheelchair as my seat is in upper deck. I asked her if any complications for wheelchair just arrange to drop me in boarding Gate. She told me not possible at all. If i will move my seat from upper deck to main deck then only possible . I asked her why . She told me we Emirates don’t provide wheelchair service in upper deck.  I asked her what will happen ,the passengers who needs wheelchair assistance & traveling in businesses class obviously seats in upper deck. She didn’t respond. Then , I been to the boarding pass counter incharge Emirates Staff- kristy as Dnata staff are not possible to make any decision without Emirates staff concern. She told me same . We can not provide wheelchair assistance in upper deck. I told her no need upper deck as I need until the boarding Room . She refused me . Very Worst Service ever in my life , received from Emirates Gatwick Airport Staff . Avoid Emirates , who need special Assistance I mean wheelchair . Avoid Avoid Avoid . Never recommend emirates again as emirates Paying RUD Staffs in Gatwick airport."
7,"Tourist class that feels like first class, great food, superb hospitality and the most comfortable seats an airline can have, top notch, 10/10!!"
8,"This was amazing, the seats were ultra comfy with loots of legroom and generous recline. My flight left on time. The food was very nice, it was a very gilling p, well cooked and still warm meal. The IFE, Emirates calls it ICE(information, communication, entertainment) Would definitely pay extra to fly again if it was an option"
9,10/12/22 Flight # A380-800 I was not feeling well and I wanted to order a coffee. I first contacted them through the app and they told me to call any flight attendant which I did. I ordered a coffee at 6 PM and we are about to land I never see the flight attendant with my coffee. Perhaps they were standing in the back laughing and chatting. Disgraceful! Their customer service sucks
10,"Boeing 777's are at least 10 years old - seats have been compressed to the point where there is barely any cushioning, so my backside was numb for the entirety of the flight. The seat in front is also guaranteed to be reclined in your face. Worse: tried to cancel a booking only to discover that the Covid freedoms are very much a thing of the past and was charged almost the entire cost of the flight in cancellation charges alone. There is no need for this. Bragging that they have ""the most generous baggage allowance of any airline"" is completely erroneous - you will be ripped off for this as much as for the flight itself. Keen to recoup your losses after the pandemic, Emirates? How about you don't leave this shortfall at the doorstep of your customers. Shameful."
11,"Emirates Airlines has a well deserved recommendation for excellence from all that I have heard in the past.We flew Emirates from Miami to Dubai and the flight was excellent. A truly comfortable Business Class, fine dining and attentive staff.  It was incredible how comfortable we were for 14 hours or so in the air.The area they truly are lacking is in their Customer Service.  I had an issue with their requirement for PCR tests at the airport because our vaccine card did not have a QR code.  When I looked at the web site, deep in the fine print was the information about that requirement.  What was truly upsetting is that multiple other travelers from other cities on direct flights on Emirates were not asked for QR codes.  I attempted to discuss this with Customer Service.  I admitted I had missed the information on their web site and the Emirates representative would only refer back to that admission on my part.  The Customer Service rep would not admit that the requirement information was poorly displayed.  Even though I had furthur comments to make, the Customer Service representative closed the discussion and I have been unable to receive further responses from them.  Great flight but soured by poor service, poor communication a lack of interest in the customer and a lack of transparency that was disturbing.An excellent business makes sure the customer is happy before, during and after the transaction.  An excellent business makes sure the customer is valued."
12,"Absolutely awful experience travelling with an infant. Flight attendant refused to provide bottled drinking water for making infant formula and out baby stroller was damaged in transit.  Emirates is trying to get out of paying compensation to replace the stroller in full. Do not use the airline if you’re travelling infants, absolute nightmare of an airline. Never again!"
13,"I agree with all the reviews terrible Airline. Our Luggage was so badly damaged they had to give us a new disgusting case to get us home, our case was part of a beautiful set of 3, We through there's away it was so bad, We got no compensation ""Shame on Emirates"""
14,I got a Emirates flight from Dublin to Dubai and Dubai to Sydney on the 6/09/2022.From Dubai to Sydney the man in the seat behind me would not let me put my seat down he put his feet on my seat.When I complained airline staff offer a middle seat I had a aisle seat.The person who cause the problem should be removed from his seat not me. Security is needed on the plane.Another problem when I got my baggage at the airport my clothes were wet.My baggage was left in the rain somewhere.
15,I love the airline I love the service but big business oil isn't the future and I just wish they would improve their ethical responsibilities. I still fly them for any long haul flights because of their fantastic service though
16,"God saves mankind from Emirates airline especially their staff in Ghana 🇬🇭, more especially those at Kotoka International Airport, Accra. Most of them are unprofessional. They discriminate and intimidate especially first time travelers. They lie through their teeth and think Ghana 🇬🇭 is an island. How I wish everyone will find it easier to take transit visa and skip emirates."
17,"Fine if you don't need any support from Customer Services. Absolutely appalling. Been trying to contact them for two months regarding a request to amend an existing booking. Multiple unfulfilled promises of calls back while they ""look into our query"". Advised to follow up via email, still no response after doing so several times. Useless and incredibly dissappointing. Going on holiday today with our request unresolved. Will never book with them again due to unresponsiveness."
18,"Flight attendants and crew least helpful.. Its not like service, more like doing a favour.Had to wait an hour after pressing the call button for them to come and even ask what is required. And then, it was 3 different crew members later, i got water. Was very difficult and inconvenient to keep my 7-yr old waiting for something as basic as water. Really need to improve service standards."
19,"Booked a round trip from London Heathrow (LHR) to Dubai (DXB) for 6 days.The experience was excellent. Multi-cultural cabin crew that will always serve to you with a smile. Their A380s are also cozy and spacious with plenty of legroom. Food they serve onboard is top quality and has got to be the best compared to any other airline. The LED lightings inside Emirates planes are also beautiful, relaxing with a somewhat calming effect; especially if it's a night flight. Would continue flying with Emirates any day."
20,"They dont treat everyone same, I wanted to change my flight dates and I can see online there were many flights available for the dates I wanted to change for when I called Emirates and told them I dont mind paying amendment fee but they code me higher price for the tickets which was cheaper on their website when I ask why I have been charging more they said the rule is different for existing customer. So buy new tickets in normal price but if you changing your tickets then you pay more plus the amendment fee. I dont know if its discrimination or what but is very unfair not treating everyone same.My call was transferred to INDIA call center where agents are very rude unprofessional and racist I would say her name was ALISHA. She argued with me for an hour on the policy for UK residents for traveling on family emergency. She kept saying she knows everything and when I asked her can speak to ur supervisor/manager as their is misunderstanding of Emirates terms and conditions for UK, she wont transfer my call and keep saying ""I know I'm right you dont need to speak to anyone as I said ma'am so I will not transfer the call to anyone as I know what Im saying and I know my job"" I find this whole experience very disturbing and very disappointed in Emirates. Qatar, Qantus, saudi and specially BA have much better customer service agents and they treat all the customers equal and fair by not charging more, the prices are equal to everyone new or existing customer."
21,"We travelled to Australia via Dubai on 13/10. The seats were okay - row 68 but the passengers in front reclined their seats throughout the entire flight (which they are entitled to) leaving us with very little space and made the 14 hour flight from Dubai to Australia really uncomfortable and draining. On the return trip I decided to upgrade to seats that offered more legroom. Don't bother! The seats, although giving more legroom are really small and very uncomfortable. The monitor for watching films is at a strange angle and tray is more suited to a 6 year old child rather than an adult. I was on the aisle seat and was bumped by passengers using the toilet and cabin crew and their trolleys. For me these were actually the worst seats ever and a total waste of money. This would be my top complaint for flying Emirates.The cabin crew were pleasant and the food was quite good. There are numerous films to choose from but they were not very good and I spent a lot of time trying to find something I could watch.Would I fly Emirates again?....……. Not too sure."
22,"God saves mankind from Emirates airline especially their staff in Ghana 🇬🇭, more especially those at Kotoka International Airport, Accra. Most of them are unprofessional.

23,We traveled business class from NYC to Malpensa in October My luggage was damaged with no chance to repair it upon arrival to Italy I filed a report with an Emirates employee who took a picture and gave me a form with a claim number I'm disabled and she said that I could buy a new luggage and request a refundThe item damaged was a Delsey brand new USD 299 plus tax I sent an email with the email provided with no response They finally send me a request to inform the brand and year of my destroyed luggage and the receipt The employee responded Barbara Arinci send me another email saying that they do not refund for my luggage but only replace or repair Mine has no chance for repairs only replacement How do they replace my new Delsey if not buying a new one??
24,Have flown quite a few times. Not so good this time. Food standard has slipped a bit.
25,Worst company I’ve ever flew with. Trying to resolve an issue on their part is extremely difficult. Me and my son have the same name. We booked and paid for the flights but only one ticket was on their system. 1 hour 45 mins on the phone and still couldn’t grasp that we had the same name even though we clearly had different dates of birth. At the check in counter had the exact same issue there and back. Some Staff on the plane act as though they’re doing you a favour and act as though you haven’t paid thousands of pounds for the flight. One female crew member pulled her face and shook her head because I was waiting for the toilet and she needed to put things in there for landing. I had to change the flights because I had done the wrong covid test. Took nearly two hours just to explain what had happened. Was told they would cost an additional £680 (down from £3000) if I took the later flight. I agreed to pay the 680 so he transferred me a lady who stated I had to pay £1080. I questioned her but her reply was the same every time. She could answer me why her collet had said 680 but she was saying 1080. Only ‘it just us 1080’ over and over again. In 30seconds it jumped from 680 to a 1080 but couldn’t explain in the slightest why  I had no choice but to pay the 1080 if I wanted to go away with my children
26,I took flight EK0011 from DXB to London Gatwick and my experience was amazing especially with the service Of our cabin crew viktoria .

29,"One of the check in ladies at Copehagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. Her colleague with dark curly hair and darker skin was even more rude and unfriendly and it seemed like she set out to make my life hell. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less. Honestly one of the worst flying experiences I have had. It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times.The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure."
30,There is a prostitute working on the this company be careful. She went with my husband to hotel five palm on 27 september. She contacted him. Her namne on instagram is Imadiziy. I wrote to her that he is married didnt mind at all to sleep with him for money. Be careful WHO ur husband speak with who works as flyg attendant.

32,"Hello Armineh,Good day! This is Elle, the agent you have spoked with yesterday regarding your refund request on the itinerary 72292249890462. Just a heads up that I just checked with the last email I've sent to Emirates but their reply is just an automated reply and doesn't still have the informations we need, such as waiver codes to process the refund. It has been 2 months since the cancellation of the flight and still no refund or compensation payment by Emirates airlines. I will keep an eye to this itinerary until the end of this day so you may save your time from calling us back until tomorrow. Please check your emails too from time to time.Sincerely,Elle N.Cheaptickets Customer Support Team"
33,Flight cancelled after boarding.Would not help me to book alternative flight to travel to a wedding.Waited hours and hours... They shouted and screamed at passengers.Next day flight went late again. Mixed up check-in for 2 flights.During transit in Dubai their staff shouted and insulted...Utter pants.Obviously they are a case of all make up and no knickers.
34,"If I could Give a Minus Star🌟  I would, it's been over a MONTH, The airlines Damaged, destroyed and went through my Bags.. I bought my Luggage in June 2022, I recently travelled to ZANZIBAR and Emirates personal BROKEN INTO MY BAGS and Gave me a DEAD bag.. to make the matter Worst, They did not respond to me with care, rather judgement if I bought the BAG when I did... With 21 Email Communications am Yet to receive a SOLUTION... Is it because of my RACE... Could  be, as whilst I was at the Airport I FELT so be LITTLED by the staff at the AIRPORT, And Making me Miss my FLIGHT! until a Man Named Mohammed who helped Me 13HRS LATER after being Spoken to anyhow, I had to Buy a ticket for my journey for their Mistakes so NOT ONLY MY BAGS WAS DESTROYED AND DAMAGE I had to purchase an EXTRA TICKET... HOW DO I TAKE THIS MATTER FURTHER as Until Now I feel Ignored, Not respected and unappreciated as a customer... This experience had Made NOT TO EVER BOOK WITH EMIRATES or EVEN GO TO DUBAI EVER AGAIN..."
35,"Tried to get a credit for cancelled flights!  Still won't sort for us even after leaving a review on here!!Terrible customer service!! never booking with them again!  when speaking to the customer service team, they refuse to even look into it further!!!"
36,"I have traveled with Emirates (booking reference:H3HKK2) and had a horrible experience in August and September 2022. I made a complaint to them with the following reference number: LON/X/JU/101019/7572977 regarding my experience on the trip and described the issues I experienced in great detail. The airline was not empathetic towards the poor experience, overall service, and discomfort they had caused to me as a passenger. They merely apologized and brushed me off. I am very disappointed and I was hoping after making a complaint, they would be more understanding and compassionate for the discomfort I experienced which was causd by them. Unfortunately, they do not care and do not do anything to make things better. I will be strongly considering using other airlines after this experience."
37,"Flew from Taipei to Dubai with Emirates. Booked leg room seats as I'm very tall. Sat in front of the stewardess and chatted with the one passenger in my row. Ended up leaving my expensive noise cancelling headphones in the case upon leaving as I was very tired. Asked about it on airport and was redirected to email the 'Dubai Airports Contact Center'. I built the whole case, was kept in the loop by this 'Dubai Airports Contact Center' for over 3 months, including hearing ""you are required to provide above details within 5 days. (19/7/2022)"", later on they wrote me ""Kindly be advised that we are in the process of preparing the item to be ready for your collection, we will advise you as soon as it’s ready."", then they told me ""kindly be advised we will advise you as soon it’s ready to be dispatched."". Finally they emailed me ""We have checked with the all the concerned units, but regrettably we did not receive any item that is matching the description given by you."" What a bunch of incompetence. I dropped about $900 on a flight and you can't even locate my item, let alone communicate properly about the process of finding it.Flight EK367, 07/09/22 [TPE-DXB]"
38,"We flew to Dubai to Male and back with Emirates . Booked leg room seats as my husband very tall . On flight home leg room seat had less room than normal seat . The seats were very expensive. There was less legroom than on normal seat . After writing to customer services as advised by a member of cabin crew who agreed with me , I was told in amongst terms and conditions it states leg room seats in certain areas of plane are restricted due to emergency exit so they would not give a refund on that seat as they apparently gave us the seat I requested!! I am appalled at the customer service reply . That seat SHOULD NOT have been sold as extra legroom . My husband was so uncomfortable on that 7 hour flight . Very difficult company to deal with , I will not be flying with them again"
39,"I a writing as I had a terrible experience when trying to board my flight to Johannesburg, South Africa with Emirates in Milan Malpensa, Italy.When looking for a flight to Johannesburg earlier this year, I chose to pay substantially more of ourtickets with Emirates (even though it was more expensive than alternative airlines) because I haveup till now only had very good experiences with Emirates.I bought the tickets for myself and my partner from Milan via Dubai to Johannesburg on the 18th ofAugust 2022 and paid for them via Paypal.Our Booking reference is I46DIB.When I tried to check in a week before flying, I saw that the check only opened 2 days before the flightleft, and as I was traveling in the days before I did not get around to checking in before I arrived atthe airport in Milan.When I went to the check in counter in Milan Malpensa they told me to go to Emirates ticket sales,as there was a problem with my ticket.When I went to the ticket sales I was told that my ticket was not paid for and that I would need topay the total amount, for our 2 return flights in cash in order to fly on the flight leaving that night.Gabriella Pinna (the manager on duty) asked if I had a proof of the payment, when I logged intopaypal and showed her a confirmation of the transaction, she was not interested in seeingthe proof of payment (with a transaction id, which could be tracked by Emirates) and maintainedthat I would need to pay cash in order to fly. I offered to email the proof of payment onto her, whichshe could pass on to the accounts department at Emirates, however she refused.I find this situation remarkable, and disappointing. Especially since I bought the tickets in August 2022and did not receive either email either from Emirates of Paypal saying there way a problem with thepayment going through.I naturally do not carry 1850 Euros in cash around with me, and felt treated like a criminal eventhough I had proof that the flight was in fact paid for.I asked if she could call someone and ask if they would look at  my proof of payment, but she wasreluctant too, only when I persisted and refused to leave the counter, did she call them. She askedthem to repeat what she had told me, that I need to pay cash, and would not tell them (even though I asked her to) that I couldemail a proof of the payment. She also refused to let me speak to them myself.Having no choice as the flight was then leaving in 2 hours, I asked if I could pay by credit card.Even though she had a credit card machine there, she refused. Myself and my partner drew out theca. 1850 euros. At additional expense in inconvenience as we had to use a foreign ATM (whichcharged us additional fees), and we needed to draw out Euros, from our accounts in Switzerland(which is in swiss francs) which incurs more additional fees. As we both have a cash withdraw limiton our cards it was not possible for us to even draw out the total amount from one of our accounts.Which meant paying the bank fees twiceThis was a horrible start to out trip to South Africa, not only have we paid for the airline ticketstwice, but our access to money to spend on our trip has also been limited as we did not budget on an additional 1850 euros.This is particularly frustrating as the money was in fact paid in full for the purchase, but there wasno interest in the evidence of this. Instead we were treated as untrustworthy criminals, who were noteven allowed to pay by credit card.I have always enjoyed flying with Emirates and have recommended it to many friends over the last15 years.When we boarded our flight to Dubai, it was exceptionally good as well, with very friendly and helpful cabin crew and a comfortable flight. In spite of this, the experience I have checking in at the ticket desk in Milan makes me think that I will not fly with Emirates again, or recommend it to anyone.If there was a problem with the transaction on Emirates system, the least that I would expect is anemail about it before hand. And an interest, in the proof of payment, I could provide at the airport. Not a totallack of interest and only finding out about this at the airport a few hours before the flight was dueto leave.I would be grateful if the money from this flight could be refunded as soon as possible.I emailed a similar complaint to Emirates, to what is written here, immediately after flying. A week later I received an email saying they would pass this onto the accounts department. 4 Days later I have still not heard back from them. I called emirates today and no one was able to help me.I find the customer service in this regard terrible."
40,Airline allowed racist passengers to have their way and apologised to them as they can drop their seat whilst we have a meal served by cabin crew. Also discriminated against us by not making reasonable adjustment. All they do is apologise but clearly their incompetence made our journey a nightmare. Would not recommend if they allow this. Be warned!
41,"Seats were selected for my family of 4 well in advance (4 months) of the travel date. Additionally my mother who was also travelling with us with a different booking was selected to sit adjacent to us in a disabled seat. We had no issues during check in as well however seats were changed last minute by emirates staff at the gate prior to getting inside the aircraft. The staff at the gate did not even apologize for the inconvenience. Their attitude was either take the seats they give or don’t fly. Despite paying extra money for the tickets to get complimentary seat selection, we were told to sit in different seats. We clearly did not receive the service we paid extra money for. This whole experience has caused a lot of inconvenience.Flight EK522, 13/08/22 [DXB-TRV]"
42,"Emirates cancelled my original flight on which I had paid $95 for an emergency exit seat. The new changed flight  had no availability of this seat type, however Emirates refuse to refund me my $95.  I was shocked by this policy and what a scam they are running.  I was told I could cancel the whole ticket but then i don't get the tax and fees back so its a lose, lose situation.   I'm disgusted that they operate this way."
43,"After sending emails to the Emirates CEO UK and Emirates CEO Dubai complaining about the excess charge for one case, I have now been blocked from both... how bad is that, they ignored my emails and then blocked me..."
44,Our flight was delayed from Perth Australia to Glasgow via Dubai . We got on the plane to be told that the delay was due a fuel fault. They hadn't managed to fix it but we're going to take off anyway and fly to India instead to refuel and then got Dubai..we missed all connections and got home a full day late ...I wrote a complaint...was ignored and offered air miles...this is a brief outline of what happened . My son is Austistic ... it was truly a nightmare
45,"Disappointed, really unprofessional staff.Me and my wife booked a flight to Indonesia for our 10th anniversary. We checked the requirements for albanian citizens prior to the trip to make sure we were prepared. On Emirates website (requirements-by-destination) Albanians dont need a visa to enter Indonesia. On the day of the flight, the emirates staff boarded us on the plane without checking our documents. When we reached there, the Indonesian customs officers did not let us get visas on arrival, they told us we needed visas before going there. They turned us back to Dubai on the same flight. When we contacted the customer affairs they blamed Batik air which was just our connecting flight from Jakarta to Bali. Isnt that such a nonsense, joke, laughable answer?"
46,Airline changed our flights to times that were much cheaper when we booked. Our original flights were be sold by emirates weeks after they changed ours.It appears that they are changing passengers flights so they can fill less popular flights and sell seats on preferred flights at a higher premium.I expect they wait until a certain point to change peoples flights knowing that flights with other airlines have increased so passengers are stuck with accepting the alternative flight Emirates offers them.Another couple I know are having the same experience and for completely different destinations.
47,"Just to say a quick thank you to the customers service rep at the Manchester Airport checkin desk.Her name is Unatti Hindocha and although she was quite new, appeared experienced and knowledgeable and very courteous.Bravo Emirates Airlines"
48,"Never book on their website, it's a mistake. They subcontract parts of the journey and then blame everything on their partners, even if you booked the full journey with Emirates. A complete joke of an airline, will never fly again, makes British Airways, Lufthansa and Ryanair all seem like Mother Theresas. They also lost our luggage and blamed their partner, meaning that our baby stroller disappeared"
49,"i prefer qatar airways, but fly emirates is the second choice for me website and app have issue"
50,"My wife and I recently caught a flight from Gatwick to Zanzibar, the first leg which was Gatwick to Dubai was incredibly disappointing, we flew with Emirates several years ago with our kids and absolutely loved the experience. This time however was very different. After boarding we quickly discovered that they have clearly changed how they work, appear friendly when stepping on the plane however they soon become machines who aren't interested whatsoever. There is no drinks service, we were only given wine with our main meal, we asked with the second meal to be told they have fruit juice or water! The food itself was very bland and dry, my wife's Indian vegetarian meal (the only vegetarian option) was actually not bad at all and I wished I had that myself. When we flew with Emirates back in 2013 we all received a little bag which had a blanket and lotions etc, a real nice touch. This time we had miserable staff that aren't interested in you or serving you, they like to chat about what they are doing between themselves and really aren't interested in paying passengers. I believe that if you are in economy they look down on you and get what is required, I'm sure if you travel business you get all the luxury. I may add that we usually travel business (this holiday was a cheap getaway). Etihad and unbelievably British Airways are way way better. I will never waste my money on Emirates again as I believe they just don't care if you are in cattle class, this I believe is as they really see it."
51,"Since 2012 I have been a twice yearly passenger with Emirates Airline. The level of customer care and attendance was exemplary. Nothing was too much trouble and the only issue I ever had resulted in no gluten free meal on the flight from Lon to BKK. The flight crew did manage to get me some food which was better than nothing.Because of previous experiences I decided to book once more with Emirates only to discover it was the worst mistake I have made since booking with Delta. I have metal plates and screws in my right ankle which unfortunately swells up on a long flight and all I require is an aisle seat that allows me to, on occasion, stretch out my right leg. This helps to prevent any swelling and of course the pain that goes with it.I have tried to explain this to a number of their so called customer service staff and I get no assistance apart from a demand for 318 GBP to sit in an extended legroom seat. I DO NOT NEED AN EXTENDED LEGROOM SEAT.They are refusing to allow me to choose a seat without paying an exorbitant amount of money on top of the 1400.00 GBP I have paid for my flights. It is clear that like most of the airlines, the pandemic resulted in experienced and caring customer service staff leaving and not returning. So the airline will just employ any idiot that can answer a phone, give you no help and even send you text messages at 02:45 in the morning telling you they are not prepared to help. I am hoping I can transfer my tickets onto a decent airline as I will NEVER use or recommend this airline to anyone again."
52,"transit flight Addis to Warsaw, over 36h delay in Dubai  as flight was cancelled. For the 36h delay, was offered one meal and  no accommodation!!!!!! 36h in the airport lobby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I kept asking for it continuously. No compensation offered either. I've lost timelines and trip was a waste of time. I see they do don't bother to reply to passenger reviews. Will take legal action. 1* because I don't have the option to go minus"
53,I had originally requested for wheelchair assistance which was confirmed. Later I booked the emergency exit seat paid the money the amount was accepted seat 88k allocatedOn the day if my flight even though I'm Bengaluru I was issued a boarding pass with 88k in Dubai they refused to give me the seat what is worse they allocated the seat to another person without checking with me. Worst still no wheel chair assistance was provided after walking almost uoto the aircraft I was told 80k the worst possible seat was allocated and wheelchair was forcibly given for a 3 minutes distance. They were proving a point. I submitted a complaint the Emirates airlines does not even have the courtesy of replying. On the flight no attendant allocated at the tail end I had to wait two hours for a glass of water after pressing the buzzer at least six times. The reply I got from the steward was we have 400 people to attend. Is that an answer you give to a customer. If I had an emergency nobody would have come. What kind of airlines is this and they call themselves world class airlines.
54,Rude Rude Rude airline crew. Racist and behaved with me so badly just because I am vegetarian and I selected vegetarian meal during my flight booking. They had not enough veg meals. When I asked what was the point of booking prior and stating veg. meals they got upset and kept targeting me during the entire flight. Hopeless airline crew who should be sacked.
55,"I hope to never fly with this chaotically unsafe airline again. We arrived in good time to check in at Dubai only to find that my wife’s and 5 year old daughters seats had been changed to be apart on the flight. Previously we had been sent an automatic allocation of seats 2 days before the flight placing them together. Despite my pointing out that a 5 year old cannot travel unaccompanied, no one seemed to care and I had to insist that a manager at least be involved. We were then taken to the aircraft in the hope that some passengers might change seats. 20 minutes past with no good news whilst we were just left to stand by the aircraft door. At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight. And then…as the doors were about to be shut..2 seats together were suddenly found! When I complained formally about the distress this all caused, a curt reply was sent denying that seats had been changed at check in. My view of this airline feels irreparable damaged and I simply wouldn’t trust them with providing a reliable and safe journey in the future when they cannot even look properly at what went wrong on this occasion."
56,"The standard of Emirates Airlines keeps rising; professionalism, comfort, care and entertainment are incomparable to any other. Food is heavenly, divine. The flight supervisor Girlie, made the experience even more outstanding with her warmth and welcoming! Fabulous trip!"
57,I booked a ticket with phone and the agent made a mistake in the spelling. When I checked on the website I found it. I asked them to change it. they ask me 30 euro. why should I give that money for their mistake.
58,"We booked a holiday with virgin but flew Emirates. we ere so excited as the hype with them being one of the best airlines to fly with.well how disappointed can you be on our return flight home from Mauritius we had to change at Dubai. the first meal they gave us was an apple turnover unfortunately neither of us eat them so tough on that one then. Lunch turned up which unfortunately I did not like so i finished before my Husband. Once he had finished he asked the hostess to remove his tray , not once or twice but four times.  two and a half hours later they removed it because we were landing in Birmingham and he had to put the tray up in front of him. No apology nothing so to be honest not impressed at all"
59,"Very bad experience.very disappointed with the service. I bought my ticket on 2nd july 2022   then had to cancel for some reason ,spoke to emirates travel advisor who suggested to fill out the refund form and I would get the full amount back .I filled the form on 2nd July 22 Emirates deducted £800 as cancelation charges.£200 per passenger I returned my tickets on the same day I bought. Tickets were available to buy ,there was no loss to Emirates.I believe Emirates tricked me advisor  tricked me to fill the return form instead of giving the correct unformation.Never book ticket with Emirares."
60,"I recently flew to Dubai with Emirates A380 from Manchester. I find it extremely uncomfortable being closed inside the cabin once the aircraft has parked by the gate. On both flights the Emirates cabin crew were amazingly supportive and took the time to care about how i felt, especially on arrival in Manchester. On my return journey two other passengers onboard were unwell - all i can say is the crew took great care of them. I have flown with Emirates many times and i feel confident to do so again. Top class cabin crew!"
61,I got a very traumatic experience flying with an infant. Never again
62,"I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back.Strike 1: The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my mother’s health and age.Strike 2: While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesn’t have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed?Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but “Her wheelchair is booked”. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airpot from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was “Our staff will be there to assist her everywhere”. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with NOBODY TO HELP HER. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter.I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen. I’ll never fly emirates again."
63,"I wish I've read these reviews before attempting to purchase a ticket. Money gone (over 3000 euro) from the bank account to Emirates airline- no booking, no confirmation of any kind, nothing! Customer Service- they will make sure to put you on hold. That's it, nothing else. I've spent most part of the day on hold."
64,"Like most other reviews, I called Emirates Holidays today to make an amendment to my booking.  I was cut-off after 30mins on hold, upon calling back, I have again been cut-off.  Really poor customer service not reflective of the premium Emirates brand."
65,"Had to cancel my flight day before I was due to fly in March due to my wife suffering a stroke. Got through to a rep within 5 minutes, very helpful and understanding. Explained I could either keep the value of the flight for two years of get a full refund. Was going to use the credit for a future flight but now to expensive for flight. Obtained a full refund within 2 weeks of requesting on website."
66,Flew dubai-stanstead on Emirates business class. Excellent service and very good flight plus their usual cheuffer service home. This 777 new business class seats are very good and specially good if you travel with family . We had our 2 young daughters with us and it was a smooth flight..not great choice of food or wine list that they used to have before but it was a relaxing flight. Stanstead has a special queue for Emirates fast track and a separate belt for Emirates business and first so out of the airport in no- time. definitely recommend this airport if flying business or first class with Emirates
67,Worst customer careEmirates customer care make Ryan Air look like private jet experience
68,"I wish I had read these reviews from people here on this customer unfriendly emirates air line. Basically I paid over £2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. I’m travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours they suddenly decided to change my original flights I’ve booked only 10 days before they’ve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any air line be so indecently insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of inhumanly sending us a little text& email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel& get refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is No other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call and when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers and we are not only devastated but also out of pocket by £2,500 because we can’t possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies. There’s no WhatsApp or any other messaging service in emirates as they are banned. There’s no law or recourse for us. I HOPE PEOPLE READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING WITH THESE CROOKS."
69,"hello, you must improve your customer support .. allmost no response! can't believev it !"
70,"I am absolutely enthusiastic with Emirates. They took really good care of everything ensuring i had the best time. 18 hrs felt like nothing. Food was great, staff was friendly made my journey to Manila absolutely priceless."
71,The Emirates call center is total waste of time just look at the picture. No response from them
72,Worst airline seat are very uncomfortable air hostesses are so rude and angry if we order water they turn off the light but never bring water food was gross spend too much money but get nothing flight EK 235 never ever travel in emirates
73,"Literally impossible to get through to anyoneThey changed my flight adding 10 hours to the journey time without even asking me, now I cant get in touch to get any help.Would not use again, absolute joke based on the amount of money spent with them"
74,Awful experience with telephone customer care.
75,"My bad experience about Emirates airlines.  Initially they allowed extra luggage allowance from London to chennai. But when coming back, they charged £ 20 per kilo for extra luggage. Usually they give extra buffer 1 or 2 kilo per passenger, they are not giving this as well. If I had known this I would have couriered in a different way. Even Airhostess crew are rude. Had to wait long time for food and drinks, until they complete unnecessary photo session.They think they are smart."
76,I wouldn’t use emirates again. My daughter is a student and going to study abroad. We spoke to a couple of customer support people who advised differently on how to book her ticket to take advantage of 10 kg of extra luggage with her being a student. We were told to go through student portal but it didn’t show her she would get extra luggage so we rang and went through it with them. The guy said it would show after we had booked it which we believed him thinking he must know what he’s doing working for the airline and that he wouldn’t lie to us. He had lied when it didn’t show up he fobbed us off with a non answer and put us through to someone else claiming they can help but they couldn’t. On raising a complaint they refused to give her the allowance entitlement and insisted it should have applied the way we did it but clearly it hadn’t. Not taking any ownership for their staff wrong advice. They won’t admit to their mistakes. They are greedy and just care for the sale and don’t care how they go about getting it they don’t care about good customer service. They also illegally took two payments for one ticket. We had such a headache to claim that back. We spoke to Sungita on 12/7/22 who incorrectly advised that she would sort it so we wouldn’t have to pay the £100 cancellation fee for their error. WeDidn’t hear back in the time frame she advised and when we rang back and spoke to Zubair on 14/7/22 he told us we had been advised incorrectly and needed to do the cancellation online. Why hadn’t she told us this? Also this guy was rude unapologetic and he didn’t care for our predicament actively refusing to help further. We ended up cancelling the flight all tougher and booking with Turkish airlines where my daughter got an even greater student baggage allowance of 40 kg.
77,"31st July, I logged in to my Emirates account and tried to book my flights online. Upon doing so, there was no pricing or points information available for each options (Saver, Premium or Business, also differences in each for each flight time) and so I called the Emirates booking line. The representative (Angelo) confirmed that there is a website glitch and proceeded to assist in my booking over the phone. I made it abundantly clear to the representative that I am looking to secure business class flights in the most cost effective way (i.e. upgrade) and that I am happy to utilise all of my Emirates SkyMiles in securing my flights. Also mentioned SEVERAL times that this trip is part of my Wedding and Honeymoon, I will also have a long Wedding Dress that will be onboard and needs to be hung in a closet (Can't be in overhead lockers). I asked the representative on how I could achieve a cost effective upgradee to business class and was simply advised to try my chances upon check in at the airport. He also suggested that by paying for my flights with cash and miles that I will save monies on the flight. Then proceeded to confirm that he made an internal request for upgrade and while that couldn't guarantee me an upgrade, will help my chances. Few days later, I was looking at the Emirates website (still not working for return flights) but then playing with the settings on a one way flight basis. It was in this way that I identified that if I had actually paid for my economy flights using just cash, that I had enough points to upgrade both myself and partner to Business Class flights for the full return from Rome to Melbourne. I called the Emirates booking line again, and after long wait times and being on the phone for over 1hour 15 minutes, the representative (Diago Santamaria) said that I would have to pay $1,000 to cancel the flights if I wanted to rebook and use the miles for my Business Class upgrade! I asked to speak to the manager given these special circumstances and not being offered this option upon booking, but was denied the courtesy to speak with the manager. I asked countless times for simply to talk to the manager, and Diago consistently refused without understanding my situation and often talked over me. I'm submitting this complaint as I should have been advised this option to utilise my points for Business Class upgrades when looking to book my flights - As the website was down (still down/doesn't show options) and I had no other way to tell and even asked multiple times the representative ""How can I get my upgrade? What can I do to increase my chances? Is there anything else I can do?"" and not ONCE was this mentioned. Should I have known this on booking day, that I can pay my flights with cash and use my points for upgrade that's exactly what I would have done! As such, I am requesting that my flights be updated to reflect as such that I wanted on Day 1.After such back and forth, a supervisor called me back the next day.  The supervisor also agreed and acknowledged that the representative did not provide all the options at the time of booking and without a viable working Emirates website, how am I to know the options to make an informed decision? I could only act on the information provided - which the supervisor did advise lacked all the options. The supervisor also agreed and acknowledged that I mentioned the website was not working at the time I called in to book. Supervisor told me to email him all my screenshots of the Emirates glitch and issue - which I did that day & got no reply. Supervisor also told me to lodge a formal complaint via Emirates - which I also did that day and also got no reply.Simply wanting to refund my flights in full, simply so that I can REBOOK both of my legs to be flexi fares and have my points returned - I am being asked for the $1,000 cancellation fee. A fee that I am being incurred because an Emirates representative was not able to provide all of the information upfront? A fee that is your internal fee, and I am rebooking with you on the same call. A fee that I am told could have been waived in the first 48 hours but because I called on the 3rd day, is it no longer viable? BY THE WAY, I only found out after 2 weeks of chasing that it could have been refundable prior - the second representative also did not advise of this.This is how they reward loyalty.NOW WITH THE OMBUDSMAN AS EMIRATES DON'T CARE."
78,"Sent a complaint into this company about the two flight changes they have made to our holiday resukting in mass disruption to our holiday. Their complaints procedure is a joke and when they do reply (with no resolution) they then do not give you an option to reply as they use a “no reply” email address.It appears no matter how much you spend on tickets and then phonecalls (at our expense) because of their mess up they have no compassion whatsoever to their customers. Emirates, feel free to reply to me personally if you have an ounce of companssion to your passengers!"
79,"After having a holiday in Dubai for 7 days, we were travelling from Dubai to Mumbai and flying with Emirates Airlines. On the 22/01/2022 at approximately 02:00 we were at the check-in desks to check in the luggage and passengers. We were travelling with 60 kg of luggage (30 kg per passenger) and 2 hand luggage trolleys of 7 kg each as per entitlement. We requested at the check-in desk to kindly check in our hand luggage as well because I was travelling with a baby and it would be difficult to handle a baby/pram and a hand trolley. The request was refused stating that we have reached the check-in allowance limit of 60 kg, but I accentuated to remind the agent that I am traveling with my child and it is difficult to travel with 2 extra hand trolleys. The agent kept refusing even showing him that I have my child that I am travelling with so how can Emirates expect me to travel with a pram and 2 trolleys but sadly and shockingly the request was refused.My husband (who was not travelling but dropping us off) made an input to accentuate and understand the situation fully. My husband mentioned that it is almost impossible to travel with a baby, pram and 2 hand trolleys but the agent was failing to understand and was being inconsiderate.My husband requested that we would like to speak to a supervisor to raise this concern with them. The agent went away and spoke to the supervisor named Kumail. After a short while the agent came back and said that the supervisor also agrees that the hand luggage cannot be checked in. We were getting really concerned at this point, so my husband asked the agent that he wants to personally speak to the supervisor. It was a disgrace to hear that the agent at the desk said to my husband that the supervisor is behind and ‘you can go there and speak to him’.  This is just very bad customer service. My husband said that we are a customer, so the agent’s job is to make life easier for travelling customers and all customers overall so call the supervisor to the desk.The agent went away to call Kumail over to the desk and my husband kindly and gently clarified to him that my wife is travelling alone with a baby so understand that it is near impossible to travel with 2 hand luggage trolleys with our baby and the pram and pointed to blame that we needed to plan better. We were very shocked to hear this. We have travelled with Emirates before and many other airlines and it is just common courtesy to assist passengers to make travel a pleasant and easy journey and enjoyable.  After hearing this we found that it was illogical and disrespectful and a customer service agent with the status of a supervisor must never speak to any customers in such a manner.In our defence we were very shocked to hear that they are not fulfilling our request to check in the hand luggage trolleys because every time we fly with emirates they use the common courtesy to take the hand luggage in even without a request and other airlines follow the same principle when travelling with a child.We found this very inconsistent and impertinent, so we went ahead to complain to the manager and asked that we want to speak to a manager immediately.After a long wait the manager came and gave my husband an opportunity to explain the situation that we are unable to travel with a baby and 2 hand luggage trolleys together. The manager named Anisa Ameer was 100% absolutely and extremely discourteous person to communicate with. She said the same thing that the hand luggage trolleys cannot be checked in and totally failed to understand that it is near impossible to travel with it and was giving us no further options. She was especially impolite, disrespectful. I cannot stress enough how rude Anisa was.  She would talk in a loud tone, would not let us talk and therefore because we had enough we wanted to escalate this matter with urgency and asked that we want to speak to a higher acting manager who we can make them understand that it is common sense and common courtesy to check in hand luggage trolleys when travelling with a baby.Anisa went away to make a phone call and after another long wait she came back to advise that she can check in 1 hand trolley only and we had to carry the other which was the most extreme difficult task to accomplish when pushing a pram.When I said ‘Thank you’ to show my appreciation she brusquely rolled her eyes and walked away with some sort of pride!There was absolutely no help offered as part of the customer service that is supposed to be offered and most disappointingly, she watched us struggle when we were going through to the border control counters.We found this hurtful and we were very sad, emotional and in tears.We found this complete experience revolting and a country that stands for humanity and an airline that displays about being the ‘best’ was demonstrated to be the worst ever!!!!"
80,Just bad on all levels. People with suspected COVID coughing and mask wearing not enforced by staff. Was served a meal with dairy in after booking a special meal in advance. I only realised after I’d eaten part of it - it’s lucky I’m not allergic. Bag damaged and not fixable. Will try my best to avoid in future.
81,"I did my booking online and not directly at emirates, thank god. If I read some of the previous critics. But Emirates have proven to me, that their ""service"" they offer on the plane is no less bad, than the one on the ground... For reasons unknown I had no blanket on my seat at departure. At first I didn't mind, as I wore a thick pullover and a woollen jacket, but still got chilled during the eight hour flight. So I kindly asked a stewardess if she could organise me a blanket...?She looked at me and said, that there should have been one on my seat, to which I replied: Yes it should have, but it hadn't. She said that that wasn't possible and that's the end. No discussion - and NO blanket. The supposed snack was only offered to passengers who happened to be awake at three o'clock in the morning. But it was no problem to switch on the lights at four (an hour before landing)  and have a loud announcement by the captain (about landing in an hour), followed by an extremely loud advertising for Dubai...I'm not a frequent flyer, but should I fly down to South Africa from Germany it will MOST CERTAINLY NOT BE ON AN Emirates flight."
82,"Right so the below is what I sent to Emirates customer services on the 4th of August after our first flight and have still not had a reply. When I booked my holiday, I specifically asked the operator if I would be able to upgrade at a later date and was told yes, I would. I also called your offices several times to check prices and was told that the best thing to do would be to wait until I checked in at the airport for the best price. This was told to me the numerous times I called all by different people. When I got to Heathrow and checked in the checking in lady informed me that I was not able to upgrade because if the ticket I had purchased. Please can you explain to me why during my numerous calls that none of the operators that I spoke to was able to let me know that my ticket did not allow me to upgrade. I thought that maybe considering everything that has gone on that I may be able to afford an upgrade at the airport for myself and my daughter but was told I wasn’t even going to be able to do this. Your customer services have really failed in explaining the situation to me and I am extremely disappointed in the way I have been dealt with. This is the first time I have ever flown with emirates as I normally fly with virgin but decided to try something new. Please can you come back to me to let me know how something like this was able to happen as it would never have happened at virgin and what measures you will be putting in place for something like lack of communication to happen again. My daughter was extremely disappointed at Heathrow on Tuesday. I am now adding to this as the experience we received on our way back was even worse. So we arrived at Male airport for our return flight and again tried to upgrade. This time we dealt with Saadha Abdulla, who hardly said a word to us and was constantly on the phone. This time she apparently managed to do the upgrade for the full trip and took the money off my card, but then told me oh sorry it not possible because of the type of ticket I have. However, she had already taken the Dollar amount from my card. She then said that she voided it. However, upon checking my bank the money had not arrived. She then dumped our passports on the side and started dealing with another customer. I asked her what was going on and she ignored me. By this time checking had already closed and so I'm assuming her supervisor Suzan Waheed came over to see what was happening. She informed me that checking had closed and that she was holding it open for us by 5 more minutes to check in. So now my daughter is in tears thinking that we won't be able to get on the flight and get home. As the money still have not been received back on my card, I had to ask my brother to transfer funds so that I could pay for the upgrade for the part of our trip to Dubai. With last calls going out we had to run all the way to the gate, and because of time shortage I have a personal accident on the way which was really embarrassing.Once we got on the plane, I sorted myself out and then my daughter sorted herself out with the blanket etc and to add insult to injury while going through the seat pocket, got glass stuck in her finger (and yes, I do have a picture her finger with a piece of glass sticking out of it) shocking. We went to the steward to ask for pillars, and he informed us that they don't have any and that I would have to take the glass out myself and then wash my hands. So, I ask the question. What happened to the onboard first aid kit, or does it only hold a wash solution which the steward poured on my hands? Well, who knows. I cannot believe we experienced such bad service from Emirates, as my title states STILL IN SHOCK"
83,Absolutely agree with the below reportBooked in July for flights to NZ jan 2023 to get seats I preferred...few days ago had a email to say tickets cancelled with no explanation why ....all phones to customer service not working as others like myself trying to get through...and also blocked on there voucher scheme as I made a few mistakes filling in ..and now can’t get through on phone to anyone to put things right ...so put in for a refund still not heard back ..terrible service from emirates
84,"Really saddened to find myself writing a disillusioned and frankly disappointed review of Emirates. Contextually - Emirates has been my Long Haul Airline of Choice since 2007. Upper tier Skywards member - so you would think - a valued customer.How wrong I was.I booked (and paid) for flights from the UK to New Zealand for February 2023 in May 2022. With the crazy pricing that is happening - No more Business Class - I decided to go Premium Economy. Changes to Emirates scheduling - meant they cancelled my flights - for ""Operational Reasons"" OK - so I called to see what my options were - well - the fun and games began, and I have to say I am beyond disappointed at the way Emirates (not the team member I spoke to) but the airline itself - through its rigid enforcement of policies and procedures - has now alientaed a long standing customer. Someone who has always lauded them, has spend THOUSANDS with them over 15 Years - and for what - Nothing !!Did they care about the loss of a good customer - no !!I will not bore you with all the details  of the poor service I have recieved - but at the end of a 40 minute call- with Customer Service - the icing on the cake was : When I booked - they took exactly 3 MINUTES - to take the money from me - and now that EMIRATES (Not Me) has cancelled my flights - it is going to take 15 Working Days to get my money back. 3 minutes to take it - and 3 Weeks to get it back.I was speechless - and was left bereft of any loyalty - to an airline that was - for a long time - my go to preference for long haul, and premium travel. Not any more. Shoddy Emirates - absolutely shoddy - the way you treat previously loyal customers - is apalling. Im going back to SQ now ! They can have my bookings and my cash !!Sir Tim Clark - the airline isn't the proud flagship - it once was. Shame."
85,"Do not use Emirates worst airline ever. My family of 7 booked flights in December 2020 to Maldives but had to cancel due to Covid. Emirates did not refund our money but extended our tickets, Now in 2022 when we wanted to travel to India we were asked to pay an additional R20 000 for tickets yet Emirates had our payment of R89 000 for over 1 year. In Mumbai we went to the airport to catch our scheduled flight but could not board because of visa issues. We asked the Emirates supervisor at Emirates counter not to cancel our connecting flight from Dubai to Durban as we had a 4 day stay in Dubai and then onward to Durban. Emirates still cancelled our flight without any notification although we were in Dubai to catch our flight to Durban. We had to book alternate flights on Kenyan Airlines at a cost pf R118 000. Emirates is now refusing to compensate us for our flight from Dubai to Durban yet our same seats were sold for R248 000. Never using Emirates again."
86,Emirates cancelled my flight and then refused to refund the seat upgrades i had paid for.  Impossible to get someone to talk to to get it sorted.  A number of calls and forms later and still no further on.  I thought Emirates was about customer experience - Terrible!
87,They were rude. I bought my ticket on the 31st of July. Canceled it on the 1st and still had to pay a fee even though the website said free cancellation within 24 hours
88,EMIRATE AIRLINES  is one of the best AIRLINES in the world with a best service for passengers und take care of children But this time unfortunately some one broke my clothes bag and I think IT’S NOT Management FAULT but maybe some Transport companies or workers did broken my bagBut I am happy with the Airlines service Thanks to all board of directors und members Your senserly Akbari
89,Very good service from ground staff and the flight crews on Emirates business class  from Oslo to Cebu via Dubai Everything was very well organized and easy to find the gate in Dubai due to app update on departure gate on arrival. Because of late booking due to flight cancellation on another airline the offered price was not too expencive.
90,"The air hostesses are so rude, unfriendly and don’t want to help. One of them came and told me that my toddler was making the flight less enjoyable."
91,I flew to Dubai on 02/07/22 and was told before i boarded the plane that my suitcase was missing. It has been 4 weeks now and i still haven't received my case back. I get no updates and if i do hear anything its a basic update with no real information. I have not been any offered any compensation and barely any apologies. I was told every day my case would arrive on the next flight while i was away. It ruined my holiday having to chase them up each day. The staff were rude and so unhelpful. I am out of pocket having now returned home and having to re buy my missing everyday items. I am so shocked at the poor customer service i have received. Never would have imagined i would be treated this way by Emirates who advertise “first class service” appalling!!
92,"I had to fly home at short notice for my brother’s funeral. The Emirates flight was £1300 (flex plus was all that was left) which was a lot more expensive than what I usually pay (about £500)When I arrived at the airport I found check in staff to be unhelpful. Then the plane was delayed but i was assured that my onward connection in Amsterdam but when I arrived at Ams my plane had departed. I was in pieces as I was fearful of missing my brother’s funeral. Emirates offered me a flight 24 hours later but that was no good.They then offered me a flight to Nairobi via Entebbe, Uganda which would get me to Nairobi on the morning of the funeral. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight for Nairobi and no reason was given ( I don’t think Emirates had booked the flight properly with Kenyan Airways)I was stuck in Entebbe with no money and no roaming on my phone so I had to Whattsap my partner back home. He spent half an hour and £60 sorting out a flight the next morning to Nairobi.To be honest cattle are treated better than this on their way to slaughter!In the end I arrived in Nairobi a day after my brother’s funeral and I was devastated.I complained to Emirates via several letters but they said the delay’s weren’t their fault and denied responsibility. They offered me some Skywards Airmiles which I said were no good to me as I will never fly Emirates again.I’m now complaining to the Civil Aviation Authority and they will find out what really happened"
93,"WORST Customer Service and airport staff are psycho( asked my son to thrown the book he was holding in his hands as it will be also consider as weight) They need to be taught what Empathy means. I booked my ticket with additional Baggage(60 Kg) at a discounted rate as additional baggage at check will cost $30 per kg, i got my e ticket, but when i went to check in they said i did not purchase, but money was debited from my card. When I checked with customer support they said it was reverted and i will get my money in 10-15 days. Problem with emirate- they took my money for additional baggage- They reverted it and did not inform me ( no mail, no text .. nothing)- they keep the money for 15 days for a services i did not use.- Thou they know i tried to purchase the service and problem is on their side, they  were not ready to give me the discounted price.- Employees with in Emirates dont have information about a booking. Airport staff asking me to call customer care when he was suppose to know everything.I will not recommend EMIRATES (flight is good), as people work there are very rude and all they don't care about customers."
94,"The worst experience we have ever had with an international airline. We almost missed our outbound flight from JFK due to their incompetence. On getting to Dubai, our luggage did not arrive with us. It took them more than 24 hours to deliver our luggage to the hotel. Coming back to US, we paid for wifi, which only worked for 10 minutes throughout the 15hr flight from Dubai to San Francisco. On getting to San Francisco, we missed our connecting flight to Phoenix because we couldn't find one of our luggage. We went to their kiosk in San Francisco to inform them we have missed our connecting flight and to assist us with connecting to another flight to Phoenix, they were rude and said we should call the reservation. We called the reservation line, explaining why we missed our connecting to Phoenix, the customer service rep was also rude, stating stating she is unable to help connect us to another flight, that we have to be responsible for booking another connecting flight ourselves. We couldn't spend the night in San Francisco, so I paid another $850 plus to get me and my family to Phoenix. On getting to Phoenix, we found the luggage that was missing from San Francisco in the Carrousel in Phoenix. The bag was ripped open and compromised. My kids shoes, dresses and our jewelries were missing from the bag. This was our first time flying with Emirate Airline and it was a really bad experience."
95,"Terrible and rude staff, the staff there are trained to be rude and cut throat, they dont even care to listen or help, yet it was a mishap on their side but it was more like stuff it, so what would you like to do, refund or....no intention to try and solve the problem.Don’t believe the Emirates hype, far from customer friendly, not worth their name on paper, terrible terrible gut wrenching experience, never using them again."
96,Outbound flight was changed and Emirates which meant I had to take more days off and then they charged me for changing the return journey even though they changed the dates themselves.
97,"Emirates Airlines are violating human rights and humiliating a passenger who was deniedentrance into the United States and involuntarily deported by USA immigration (NOT criminal).The US immigration officer stated TWICE that the deported person will be sent back home totheir original boarding city for no cost to the passenger. Passenger wasn’t able to choose theflights and the immigration officers were the ones that booked his flight and escorted him backto the plane.However, after arrival into Dubai from Miami, the Emirates Airline agents detained thepassenger, took his passport (which is his form of ID) and are holding him hostage and unableto leave the country back home until the flight is paid for. The first available flight is 2 days fromnow and the passenger is unable to leave the airport or stay at a hotel due to the detainedidentification. Passenger was previously traveling for 3 days straight, hasn’t slept, is stressed aswell as frustrated, not feeling well due to the whole situation, the amount of travel, and thepsychological pressure from the agents, etc. The agent stated that if the flight isn’t paid for after24 hours, they will call the Dubai police and the passenger is going to be arrested and dealt withaccordingly.After some research and contact with the passenger embassy we found out that the unwillinglydeparted individual is not responsible for the cost of the flights back due to said deportation.While attempting to talk with the “agent” who continually berated us with a bad attitude,unwillingness to listen and solutions to the problem, as well as psychological pressure, theagent stated that the US immigration officer was “a liar” and that the passenger who wasinvoluntary denied entrance into the US is responsible for the cost of the flight home (which hecannot afford). The agent continuously would repeat “listen, listen, listen” trying to shut us upand refusing to hear what we were trying to explain to him. He stated that the passenger needsto contact his friends and family begging for money for the full cost of the flight of $1,750. Theagent refused to believe that we were just helping the passenger with translation and insinuatedthat we could pay for his flight instead. When asked for his name and title to know who we weredealing with he refused to provide that information except for the first name that sounded like“Vahlid”. When asked to further specify this information he would just raise his voice and getangry asking “why do you need to know this information?”. After multiple attempts of trying tohave a civil conversation with this person, he simply walked away.Even if the passenger somehow manages to find the money, the next available flight isn’tavailable until 2 days from now. In accordance with ICAO (International Civil AviationOrganization) when a layover is more than 12 hours long, the airline is supposed to provide thepassenger with a hotel or place to rest. Emirates Airlines refused to do this as well for thepassenger which means the passenger is stuck in the airport terminal for more than 2 dayswithout a bed, shower, or any comfort.#emirates #emiratesairline"
98,"I booked a ticket for my daughter where I made one misspelled of her last name; Anastasia instead of Anastasya. To make the revision,  Emirates charged us GBP 20 :("
99,"Ten days before my hols, I was making a checklist.I happened to go into the Emirates app to find that there was a star next to the itinerary tab; I went into it, only to find my flight had changed from morning to later afternoon.I had not received any email or text message to say they had changed it. I called the emirates help desk. Useless! Faced with appalling customer service. With no explanation as to why it was changed Going with a family of four with a child with health conditions. Emirates, are happy to take your money upon booking but to address any concerns you are only asked to fill in a feedback form!Terrible."
100,The que line of emirate desk at the airport of of zurich is so long and slow it was only on desk open for online checking !!! They did not even bother to open an other deskI dont see the point to do online checkin to wait 2 h in The que Thank you and bravo emirates
101,"I am never one to leave bad reviews, however the rip-off that this Airline is, I would never recommend anyone use them....Ever! We had our flights cancelled while on vacation as result of Covid impact and at the time were informed we could keep the tickets for future flights or choose to receive a full refund . (This ended up being a load of Bull)We opted for the refund. They ended up removing charges for taxes etc and for a flight from South Africa to London (which is expensive by the way) we only received £90.60 in return for each of the tickets(2). None of this was fully explained, also they did not give a CRAP that as result of their cancellations, we needed to spend additional funds to extend our stays at different hotels and they did not open flights at all, so we needed to book with another airline which cost us even more to get home.The lack of empathy, consideration and the exorbitant and daylight robbery charges taken off the refund shows that they do not care about customers and that they are a monopoly hungry airline.We have decided to go ahead and log further complaints through UK Aviation authority as we know they have done this to many other customers which found themselves in the same situation."
102,"Got an urgent issue you need to solve? Sorry, there’s no way to do that. Try in a month.Contact via live chat? Never available.Via facebook? All that you get is, automated messages about how much they care about your concern.Phone number? Only if you’re calling from the country of your departure.May be email? Wait for a week and get an email redirecting you to facebook. So much fun.Oh right, and whatsapp doesn’t work either."
103,"I have attempted to book seats on my upcoming flight to go on my honeymoon and have encountered an error (several times) which asked me to contact Emirates and gave me a phone number to call. I rang the phone number (Emirates Airlines) to be told that there is an issue with one of the tickets and that I'd need to contact Emirates Holidays for them to re-issue it. I contacted them on the number provided, after being passed from one person to the next and intermittently sitting on hold for 2 and a half hours I gave up and emailed a complaint! The response was to try booking the seats via the Emirates App - tried this, it didn't work. Later the same day I received a phone call in response to my complaint, during which I was told to try and book the seats again and they would 'talk me through' how to do this, like I was incapable. After doing so the same error message appeared once again. She then told me that I would need to speak to Emirates Airlines because she can't take secure payment for the seat booking on the number she was calling from. She said to ask to speak to a supervisor if the person on the line was unable to help. I have spoken to Emirates Airlines again this morning who have said that I once again that it is an Emirates Holidays issue, there is something wrong with the ticket issued for my partner on one leg of the flight. I asked to speak to a supervisor, as I had been advised the previous day but they wouldn't put me through. They said that they have looked into the issue and I would need to speak with 'flight centre' in order to get the problem resolved, spouting a load of nonsense about the code on the ticket that I didn't understand, but that they would update the notes so that the next person would know what the issue was. I am now sat on hold, to who knows, waiting for the issue to be resolved.This isn't the first issue that we've experienced with Emirates either, the first was a change in our flight which has probably triggered all of this mess."
104,"Customer service is appalling just to speak to someone takes over 1/5 hours. trying to finalize my trip to Dubai and Thailand, considering cancelling and going with another provider after already spending 11k with them"
105,"We had our Holiday to Dubai booked for this Autumn but with Covid cases rising and further restrictions being heavily policed with uncontestable fines we thought it best to avoid Dubai for numerous reasons.Emirates said they are not Tui and do not consider any holiday issues to be the responsibility of anybody beside the customer who is gambling booking with them.We only wanted a delay or move destinations, we made no request for a full or partial refund.The attitude was have a miserable holiday or lose your money altogether.Obviously they are to big to need to provide customer satisfaction.Honestly, what a shame in the way Emirates have moved forward in making a living as sky bandits."
106,Worst customer service ever - luggage handling. I flew from Copenhagen to JFK with Emirates through Dubai. My luggage didn't make it through. I filled out a PIR report in the airport when arriving. Emirates located my luggage but delivered it to the wrong address!!! I have called customer service 8 times over the last week and they all promise to help however no-one ever get back or help find the luggage. Result is that my two suitcases are now lost somewhere in New Orleans and I am not able to get any refund from Emirates as no-one ever gets back or want to help.
107,The  worsest airplane staff I have ever experienced in life.They are heartless  racist and extremely rude.
108,"Worst airways ever.  The use the most fraudulent methods to deceive passengers.  The firs flight was delayed for 3 hours!  So my wife could not make to her second flight.  They have not given her another boarding pass, no hotels, nothin.  She has waited there for 6 hours and they Emirates staff in Dubai do not answer her.  So frustrating.  We even found a flight on Sky Scanner website and shown that to them.  But they avoid to book that for her.  Shame on Emirates airways all over the world."
109,"EMIRATES from Dubai to CPH: the biggest fraud and the most incompetent Airline ever witnessed - and I’ve been around. For a ticket Price of 9.000 DK / 1.350 usd one would at least expect a seat you can sit in, “especially” when other empty seats are available. But NO. Not according to their policy. So standing for 6 hours it is. My seat in flex had 30 cm space bcs a Huuge guy was sitting next to it. If I wanted to change, then “I” had to pay extra. I even invited the crew to sit and see themselves, but they politely declined. Ehmm OKA top run airline with a staff working as a swarm of entitled sheep, giving absolutely no care to revenue passengers. A mentality so ridiculous that it’s hard to comprehend"
110,"Check in at the airport (DXB) was terrible. The lady was on TikTok and we spent about an hour to check in less than 15 people. I saw the TikTok on her phone screen when she called us up to check us in. They were so slow and could care less about us all. The flight attendants who served us were very terrible also. They were treating us as if we didn’t belong there, or as if they were doing us favors. We were really excited to try Emirates to have the experience, but it turned out disappointing and very unimpressed. Emirates Airline was one of our dream airlines to travel on, and it turned out to be a disappointment. This 16hr DXB-DFW flight has been the worst experience for us, and I hope it’s the last time. I thought Emirates was the best out there, but I think I might be wrong (based on such bad experience and treatment)."
111,"On 1st july 2022 me and my fiance we boarded a flight from kenya,the passport control was delayed due to unknown cirmcustances..we were patient more than the expected time..Finally we boarded the flight and we were welcomed in a warm matter..so as we proceeded our journey we felt thirsty and ordered drinks as per procedure we pressed the call button thrice for the  crew to come through..we got our first drinks swiftly the lady was so nice and  so welcoming..the second call we got a different crew she had eye glasses name by Zesrine Zbidi very rude and unproffetional staff who felt bothered each time we ordered for something she  even talked very rude to us saying that she will confirm if they had drinks left whereas other crews gave us whatever we needed upon request she even gave us a shouting voice upon request i have personally known emirates for top notch service not such a staff with attitude and rudeness please as management you should look into the matter coz not only me had complain but the rest of my surrounding who were angry...Emirates is the best flying platform please keep up but such people ruin our experience.."
112,"We travelled from Seychelles to London on the 21 May at 23:50 on 21 May, with a transit/ connection at Dubai airport. We arrived at Dubai from Seychelles at 04:20 in the morning on 22 May. Our flight from Dubai to London departed at 07:45 on 22 May, but we were asked to be at the boarding gate at 07:00. Boarding had started when we arrived at the gate at 06:45. Given that we were on the midnight flight from Seychelles, and were not served breakfast before landing, we were expecting to be served breakfast on our flight from Dubai to London, especially as we were boarding at 06:45. However, this turned out not to be the case. It must have been an hour later during the flight, around 08:45 that we were finally given something to eat and drink. It was a small jam pastry, a very small pot of yoghurt and a cup of water. We were offered a hot drink and I had some tea. The breakfast was very small, more of a snack, and I was very surprised that Emirates were not serving a full breakfast at this time. My husband and I were very hungry and couldn't sleep, despite only having slept 3-4 hours that night, due to our journey. The flight duration was 7 hours and 40 minutes. At 11:30 am, I got up and found a steward and asked him for a snack. He told me that they will be serving lunch in 30 minutes, and gave me a couple of packets of savoury biscuits. His manner was dismissive and cold, the sort of manner that aircrew reserve for economy passengers who are clearly beneath them. We ate the biscuits but were still hungry. I am not a big eater and am petite, but not having eaten since 23:00 the night before was taking it's toll. In frustration, I pressed the attendant button from my seat, as we were asked to fasten our seat belts due to the turbulence. No one came. Finally, we were served lunch at about 13:00 and I did complain to the stewardess. There was no apology, she just said I should submit this online complaint. I noticed that it took her about an hour to serve lunch as she was serving meals and drinks on her own without another staff member to help. This is unusual as we normally see 2 staff serving from each trolley. I was very disappointed in the flight and if I'd known better,  my husband and I could have had breakfast at Dubai airport before boarding. But then, why should we, when the air tickets are quite expensive. It is normal to expect breakfast on a flight during 7 -9 am, don't you agree ? All in all, we won't be travelling with Emirates again."
113,If I can give 0 I will bc of the  service of mostly of the staff of Emirates they are so rude & the way how they talk & they talk about the customer front of you it’s normal u will hear that tow staff they are talking & laughing about you on you face and also when you ask a help in the airport he Scream on my face & even on general the staff when they ask for something they ask by order . As Emirates airlines they have to provide a training to teach her team how to handle the customer and how to approach them and to give good customer service bc sorry to say as Emirates has very bad customer service only very few staff they are polite
114,"Terrible and rude front desk workers, not only did they deny my flight because my valid Covid test didn’t have a QR code, but they were extremely rude and aggressive about it, never experienced more disrespect from an airline in my life"
115,dubai airport looking for monitor for my next transfer asking everyone was at diffrent terminal took me over hours getting through there secuity then getting otherside missed my plane there one team saying dont we get on the next one then they charged me many others for our next flights what a con there many money out this way i never again will use them
116,"Hi, Check in crew didnt provide information that face masks are mandatory for boarding the flight. However they asked for face mask while boarding the flight otherwise we will not be allowed to board. 40 mins for flight departure and we were asked to clear immigration and go to a store in airport to buy a mask. Clear immigration again and come to gate for boarding. Immigration queues are so long due to holiday season how can such a crucial information can be provided in the last minute. Experience with emirates crew has been worsened even before boarding."
117,"Emirate is the worst airline to fly with.  Please do not fly Emirate.  The staff crew were rude and disrespectful to my disabled aged mother.  Despite medical clearance from our doctor,  my mother was refused entrance in the plane.  When we asked for a refund from CS, Emirate lied to us and stated that my mother was a no show.  I also noticed when I had flown with them that they were prejudiced towards Africans of darker skin and would ignore any request asked to their hostesses by black people.  DO NOT FLY WITH THEM!!!!"
118,"I flew Emirates in business class from Australia to London. On arrival, my cabin sized bag (which I checked in) was very badly damaged. The bag is over 3 years old but in light of the lockdowns Australians have endured in 2020 and 2021, the bag has been used only 4 times. It was an expensive bag and costs approximately GBP370 to replace.  After going through the hoops in making a claim with LHR (that deals with compensation in these matters), an offer of GBP173 was made. I rejected this offer and was told to contact Emirates direct. I did, and have sent 2 emails. Other than an automated message acknowledging receipt of my complaint, I have not received any real or effective response from Emirates. Considering the amount involved, and considering how much I spent on the business class fares, Emirates should deal with this claim quickly and efficiently. As things stand, I would choose another airline before flying with Emirates again."
119,"If there is option, i will give them 0 stars. Dodgy airline. When I called, I was misguided about Dubai connect. Curtomer service almost non existent. Trying first time and such a terrible experience. I will never use Emirates ever again."
120,"Flew Emirates first class from Manchester to Dubai and then Seychelles. The service was amazing, the crew were the best . Emirates airlines was a experience to remember, sadly the same can’t be said for there sister company ( Emirates holidays )  Complete opposite to our experience with the airline . It’s a shame Emirates airlines doesn’t run Emirates holidays . Would most definitely recommend Emirates Airlines, but sadly not Emirates holidays ."
121,"Just cannot get through on the phone to sort a query relating to a flight they refused refund in Covid, now I want to redeem my credit...they wont take the call. Call handling system is abysmal. No estimated wait duration or place in the queue. Emirates, you in the dark ages..."
122,"I booked a round trip from Raleigh, North Carolina to Bangalore via Emirates.com website.  Flight from Raleigh to JFK was operated by Jet Blue.  Because JetBlue got delayed, I missed a flight from JFK to Dubai.  I was stranded at JFK airport, at night 2 am with no help from Emirates. I am just a 19-year-old female.1) Once they announced the delay, I asked Emirates help desk in Raleigh to postpone the trip to the next day.  They blatantly denied it. 2) After reaching JFK at 1 am due to delay, I went to Emirates JFK Terminal-4, the lady there refused to help saying it is JetBlue's problem (even though ticket was booked through Emerites.com web site.  I had to take an Uber ($25) from Terminal 5 to Terminal 4, because air train was broken.3) Huge line in front of JetBlue, after 1 hour wait - JetBlue told me that I need to go back to Emirates at Terminal -4.  I told JetBlue that I had already gone to the Emirates help desk.Finally, after 3 hours of deliberation between Emirates and JetBlue, I was booked on an AirIndia flight because Emirates flights are ""fully booked""."
123,"Glas- Dubai-Perth and back again.The whole trip delivered by the onboard crew was great, very hard working people and always had you covered , my only negative was the interior of the 777 on all legs of the journey, they are starting to age now with their ICE screens being unresponsive, broken connections to headphones, chairs not reclining , time for a revamp Emirates .Got me to where I needed to be on time and safe so thank you ."
124,"We have flown with Emirates many times, they have been average in the past but recently extremely poor. Booking in was average and we asked about upgrades willing to pay the difference but the lad checking us in was indifferent and dismissive. Paid for extra legroom but that was a waste of time and money. Seats on the plane very uncomfortable and the crew didn't care about the passengers. Food inedible. Got there and enjoyed a very nice holiday in Dubai, so much so that we are going back in September. Flying back to the UK we asked again at DBX about paying for upgrades but was told the flight is full. TOTAL LIE. after boarding we saw that were a number of business seats empty. So they would rather lose money than go to the trouble of upgrading and earning some money. Booked yesterday and tried to use their loyalty miles to upgrade again but the system doesn't let you just goes round and round all the time. I gave up. So we will lose all the miles we have accrued over the years, because of the pandemic they have timed out.If you want decent service and some recognition of being alive then use another airline. I hear the service on Qatar and Etihad is good and a damn site cheaper."
125,"I was travelling alone with my 20 month old baby and was already under a lot of stress. My baby was sleeping when I boarded the flight at 4 AM, so when I was settling down I could only drop down the carry bag, from my shoulders, in front of me. The baby was sleeping on my lap so I was waiting for the help of the stewards to put my bag in the storage area. When I politely asked one of them if he could place my bag in the storage, he did it hesitantly saying that 'I will do it this time, next time you have to do it yourself. How RUDE is that ? I absolutely saw no EMPATHY at all in his response even though he could clearly see that I was travelling alone with a baby (no passengers were sitting next to me too) !!! I raised my concerns with their customer support team but they were justifying their crew saying that they were not obliged to help in that situation by their requirements. What a waste of my time writing to them. Pathetic people."
126,"Just called their customer service to get some help making changes to a flight. Gave all my details to customer support, and they said they'd put me through to the right team, sat on hold for 40 minutes only to be spoken to like an idiot by the person on the other end of the phone. Told me there is nothing they can do to help as I booked through Expedia and when I explained that Expedia won't help me either because it is a flight credit he said he didn't care there was nothing they can do. Very blunt, rude and all-around unhelpful - not the message Emirates seem to put across on their lovely TV ads about their ""amazing customer service"" is it??? Shocking"
127,"I used to like this airline but not after this scam experience. I bought a business class round trip from Bangkok to NYC about 6 months before the travel date. However, a month before - my work plan changed and I need to change my return flight. Cannot make changes online so I called a rep. After waiting on the phone for him to calculate the fare difference (the reason why it took 20 mins cause he said he had to calculate the fare manually), he told me that the fare difference is 150,xxx Thai baht, which is around $4,400!!! If you want flexibility to make changes to your itinerary, DO NOT book Emirates. Now I still don't know what to do because I can't change my flight and cannot attend this important meeting!!!"
128,"I have been trying to get hold of Emirates for the last month. Waited hours on hold just to be cut off, live chatted multiple times and emailed. Haven’t had a response off them at all, one agent got back to me on live chat began to help and then ignored the query, no response since. They are quick enough to contact you to pay the rest of your holiday off though!!! We are in need of moving are holiday, now we don’t want to even go with them as a company! They have ignored us for that long we could lose all the money we have paid! Awful customer service, wouldn’t ever book with this company again! Why would you pay for a service if you can’t ever get in touch with them for help!"
129,"Until recently Emirates have been amazing. This morning was my 11th return flight with them. It was 5 hrs into the journey before food was served, unfortunately when it arrived I had nodded off. I saw the people around me with food so buzzed the attendant. It took her around 20 mins to come to me, when she did she was very crosscat having to go and get me some. I felt like I was putting them out. For the price now charged to fly this service is unacceptable."
130,"I've been very dissapointed with Emirates' services lately. They used to be classy and quality airline with fantastic customer service, however now it takes hours and hours to get through to someone for assistance. Using their chat feature on their website is useless - it doesn't even place you in a queue, it just tells you to try again."
131,"Due to having a hip replacement while in South Africa it became necessary to change my return ticket to the UK. Having an open business class ticket didn’t appear to be a problem with a change of date especially as I was able to give three weeks notice, wrong. After many long attempts to contact bookings I managed to get through only to be told everything is fully booked but I can be waitlisted, but they can get me on the flight for an extra thousand pounds, so much for fully booked. I’m now stranded in RSA after my operation with no idea when I can get home. I’ve tried for two weeks to get through to customer care and bookings without success often holding on for over 2 hours before giving up. Emirates has lost its empathy with its customers, its service reputation just for pure financial gain. This is the price of 20 years of loyalty and gold member, wake up Emirates loyalty goes both ways."
132,Best Airline By Far! Flight Attendants Were So Kind!
133,"I need to travel with a 18 month old child and as I have never traveled with a child before I am not sure whether he would be happy on my lap or on the bassinet or on his own seat. I thought it is better to have all the options open, as it is a long haul flight and paid for the extra seat.After booking, I tried to book the bassinet. They said that I can't have the bassinet as I have already paid for a child seat! I paid nearly £600 for the child seat, only to be told that the child will fewer options because of it. Absolutely ridiculous.I asked them to cancel the child ticket and they have kept me on hold for the past 50 minutes as I am writing this review."
134,"I flew out to Thailand- Manchester - Bangkok on one  of Emirates A380's on an economy ticket. I found the seats very cramped and uncomfortable for the 17 hour flight; however they did give us plenty of food and refreshments on this outward journey; and that is why I booked our return flight with them. I booked this return flight just recently back to Manchester with my new wife- again on economy tickets. This time it wasn't an A380 in 2 hops but a Boeing 777 from Bangkok to Dubai for the first leg- a night flight.That 777 was a dirty smelly and very noisy old aircraft we were crammed into for the initial 6 hours of the journey. All we got was a Danish pastry for that part of the journey, which to say the least was very disappointing. As for Dubai- this has got to be one of the biggest and very busiest hub airports in the world. It is very modern and very architecturally beautiful but finding your way around it is an absolute nightmare. To get to go between different gates you have to find your way by train-, it's so big; and you have to negotiate different elevators and levels as well. If you are not good on your feet- or find it difficult to walk long distances like me -a wheelchair is essential complete with an Emirates assistant to push you. Don't be afraid to ask because they will help you. You need to tell them when you book your ticket so they are prepared for you. They put a priority sticker on your luggage as well at check in and your assistant will get you in the queue as well as get you transferred to your relevant gate- at a cost of course. (Tipping generously we found pays dividends here) This worked flawlessly on the trip out but on the trip back to Manchester there was no one to meet us with a chair and they never announced would priority customers come forward when getting off the plane. We were just left to struggle on our own  to the Immigration area where there must have been 600+  people queuing to see just 4 Border Force officers. We waited the best part of 2 hours to get seen and be cleared entry. In conclusion; the main problem with Emirates long haul East from UK and back; is the fact that you've got to go through Dubai, where Emirates HQ are actually based. Inevitably you will stop and transfer there onto another aircraft. You take potluck what type of plane you get- good, bad or indifferent- old or reasonably new. Like I said - Dubai Airport is a nightmare of busy ness  and not particularly well signed either to find your way around. I believe Emirates are introducing their Premium Economy seats very soon - but frankly they should have better and more comfortable seats in their aircraft in the first place. We paid the best part of £1450 for the two of us Economy from Bangkok to Manchester which at £725 each to our minds is extortionate. Particularly for one half of the flight- all you get is a very dry Danish pastry apology for a sandwich. 🤮"
135,Flew Birmingham to Dubai return. Outbound we flew economy and service was front to back so at the back we were last with limited food choices. It took hours to get a drink and when I pressed the bell to ask for a drink - which others were being served individually - I was pretty much told off. So on the return we were offered an upgrade to business at a cost. So we took it. When we arrived at the airport we were naturally excited about travelling business but then then check in staff were rude when I asked about the lounge. I was apparently on a special fare which didn’t allow lounge access. What the hell? Isn’t that part of the business the business experience. We went abs asked at the lounge to again be treated rudely and told it was £200 to access the lounge. We felt we were treated very discourteously. On board we sat in row 1. We then discovered that service in that cabin was back to front on every service. So it took 1.15 minutes to get a drink after take off in business. This was ridiculous. It didn’t end there. We were now at the back end of food selection so nothing we wanted was available. On every service. You would think they would offer service in different orders so that every passenger experienced a good service. But no! Then if I asked for something I was again greeted with rudeness. I would never fly business with Emirates again and I would definitely consider an alternative airline even in economy.
136,"Worst Customer service you can imagine.It appears Emirates Airline lives in a different world with no knowledge or understanding of customer service.I had my suitcase wheel broken in my return Flight to Sydney on 20 May. That’s understandable, accident happens.I expected them to collect the suitcase and repair it for me, instead they just simply asked me to take my suitcase to a particular repair shop (which was 1 hour drive from my place) and advised they will repair it for me.I had to drive 2 hours round trip and pay $16 for the Parking Ticket just to deliver my suitcase to their repair shop. The person in the shop mentioned he cannot replace the wheel with the exactly  same one but he can try to find a similar wheel as a close match. It was very disappointing because now their problem becomes my problem!!It was the Airline that broke my suitcase in first place! So why should I drive two rount trips , each trip 2 hours , pay the parking ticket to just get an inadequate repair and  unsatisfactory outcome. I called Emirates Airline to discuss it, After 30 min waiting, Aida from Dubai call centre attended my call, I explained my concerns and Aida promised that she will get someone from Sydney team to contact me in couple of days to help me out. Well, no one called yet after a week.I've been trying few more times to get a hold of people in call centre, but  no luck even after waiting for 50 minutes on the line. I called DNATA office, talked to Cess and explained everything to her again.  She just mentioned she only can escalate this to Emirate Airline and they are people need to call me. It is absolutely frustrating and disappointing. I will never fly with Emirates Airline again and will not recommend them to anyone due to their terrible customer service."
137,Flew to DUB from LHR on 21 May. Worst check in of my like. Moody and surly male agent. Airline messed up my extra paid for baggage allowance and demanded an extra $541 which I had to pay on the sport. Check-in clerk looked like he would rather be anywhere else than where he was. Quite frankly a career change for him would be a relief for the customers. Choose another airline!
138,Different application of carryon rules by country and passenger. Clear discrimination from Cochin!
139,"Booked a flight from Bangkok to Newcastle UK and after booking received an email telling me that the payment had not gone through, so I phoned Emirates direct and was met by a wall of incompetent clowns, I eventually said if the payment has failed then cancel altogether and I will rebook.Which I did then the Jokers took double payment from me told me I would have to wait 20 day to be reimbursed and that was subject to terms and conditions and I would be penalised.These people are so very incompetent!! Never again"
140,"I have booked a round trip with different destinations with Emirates including their partner airline FlyDubai. The flight from Brussels to Dubai was a good flight. The connecting flight to Durban was with an old plane and most things didn't function. After that I took 2 flights with other airlines which were okay to Entebbe. My flight from EBB to Dubai was booked with FlyDubai. That fight was cancelled and they booked me on a flight for the next day. This one was also cancelled without informing me. No email from Fly Dubai or Emirates. I was forced to book a flight with another airline to get back home on time. Emirates use to be a world class airline but they are no longer a world class airline. They are no different from any other airline. No service, no staff and flying to and from an overcrowded airport in Dubai."
141,"Really disappointing. Rubbish service, rude staffTerrible food (for lunch just a minipizza???? I was literally starving during my 18 hours flight ), no snacks in between meals, staff never asked if everything was ok, they seemed  annoyed when  people asked them something!! Really Overpriced! the  airplane   was old and uncomfortable. Unclear information about luggage weight. I booked a flexible fare,  It was written that  35 kgs of luggage  were included. When I did the check in instead, They charged me  for extra weight (around 500 euros), claiming that the allowed weight was 30kg.Never Never again with Emirates!!! As a piece of advice, Avoid them!!"
142,"We are making an official complaint about getting refused boarding on the return flight EK0033 from Dubai to Newcastle on 25th May 2022 at 14:25. We demand for our alternative flights to be booked free of charge as well as a full compensation for the accommodation, other expenses incurred and mental turmoil caused by being refused to board the flight.On the 15th May 2022 my wife and I arrived to Newcastle airport to board our flight to Dubai at 21:10. At the gate of the Newcastle airport, we realised that we might need my wife's biometric residence permit (BRP) card, although we had digital copies of the BRP card front and back side. Then we asked Emirates airlines staff at the gate to confirm if we would be able to return to the UK without having the physical card with us. Member of the Emirates staff working at the gate phoned the UK immigration staff to confirm this. Subsequently she told us that we will be able to return to the UK as long as we have the photo of the BRP card. We asked her again if we can definitely return back without the physical card and she confirmed that yes we can as long as we have the photos of it. Following this we were allowed to board the plane to fly to Dubai. If at that point we were told that there would be an issue with not having the physical card we would not take the flight. Also we should not have been allowed to board the flight by the staff knowing we don't have this card which is needed to complete the journey. This is a complete fault and failure of the Emirates airline staff. On the 25/05/2022 we made it to the gate on time before our return flight from Dubai to Newcastle departing 14:25. At the gate my wife was refused boarding due to not having the physical BRP card. We explained to the staff that we have been told by Emirates staff in Newcastle that we can use a digital copy of this card to return back to the UK. We provided the digital copy of the front and back side of the BRP card. Despite all of this, my wife has been refused boarding the flight. We were then told by 3 different staff members at the gate that we can get a replacement flight booked for free. Since the staff told us this, I stayed with my wife in Dubai to assist her in getting her card back to be able to return to the UK. We went to speak to the ticket office at the airport and we were told that we would have to pay a no-show fee and a difference in flight prices to book replacement flights back to the UK. This is a completely different story than what the staff at the same airport told us when we were refused boarding at the gate.This situation has caused us a great amount of mental turmoil and stress as well as significant expenses all due to the failures of Emirates staff. We had to find a hotel at the last minute to stay in Dubai until we sort out the BRP card which involves more expenses. Then we will need to get alternative flights from Emirates to return back to Newcastle. We are contacting Emirates about the full compensation. Otherwise, we will involve legal representative to handle this case."
143,So I reached out to the group booking department of emirates to see if I can get a group discount for my party of 10 people.At the time I reached out the tickets was $954 USD per person they responded to me 5 days later with a group discount of $1600.69 USD per person when ask how is that a discount the response was well that all we have to offer for our group rate at the moment and feel free to go book it online .Now tell me where is the discount here.However im back online looking to book the tickets they went up now to $1029 my issue with this situation is don't say u offer group discounts if u gonna come back with a price that is almost twice the amount of your price listed online and now that I been waiting on a response for 5 days the tickets basically is up by a whole $75 and for those reason their customer service group department deserves 1 star .
144,"Flight EK005 on 25th May 2022 was a fantastic experience and we cannot thank the team enough for their care and attention to us & ""everyone"" onboard. Helping mothers with children, people with movement difficulties and those with no impairments at all. A special mention to Natalie, Nozom and the whole steward team exceeded at everything. It was such a pleasure and I hope you get the recognition you clearly deserve. You set the bar very high for everyone else."
145,"We have a holiday booked and wish to make a change so that our son can come on holiday with us.  We have been trying to telephone, WhatsApp and chat to an assistant on their web page, for 3 days, all to no avail.  DO NOT BOOK A HOLIDAY WITH THIS COMPANY!"
146,"Avoid!I booked a flight to the UK and was advised by their live chat customer support that the long 18 hour layover in Dubai included accommodation and transfers within Dubai. It also states on their website that economy fairs also include Dubai connect. I have flown with a number of airlines with a similar system and had no issues. Sri Lankan airlines were incredible and seemless. When I went to confirm that it was all booked for the Dubai Connect, the exceptionally rude and unhelpful live chat (Jesika) simply sent me a link to terms and conditions that was 100 pages long advising that my fare was too low so I wont get anything.The customer service that I have experienced and the lies that I was told when booking is shocking for an airline that supposedly prides itself on a high standard. I cancelled my flight and will fly with an alternative airline."
147,"I flew from Bali to Dubai. I brought 3 check in bags in which 1 I had to pay. First, I was asked what type of payment. I said Visa. The ticketing counter tried to process my credit card payment. Their CC system failed. They sent me to a separate counter only to tell me that they could no longer take credit card, only cash. The Emirates website or anywhere on the Emirates app mentioned this. I did try to call the Emirates office in Bali to purchase my extra baggage early as the Emirates website suggested. Of course, the office was closed during its broadcasted office hours. So much for the world’s #1 airline…so overrated:-("
148,"I am a silver card holder with emirates, and fly frequently business class with them.  I booked with Emirates last year for a trip to Hong Kong and Dubai to celebrate my 50th birthday. I am due to fly in 3 weeks time, however Hong Kong is in lockdown. I am only going to HK for 4 days, but when I get to HK , I need to self isolate in a government hotel for 7 days. Simple maths…..I can not get back out of HK for my flight to Dubai as my quarantine period is 7 days. I will miss flight. When I called and explained this to Emirates, they proceeded to tell me if I change my flight I need to pay £2,500. I think this is appalling, and is out with my control. It is not my fault HK have gone into lockdown. Emirates say they are still flying to HK and therefore I can still get there. I will be lucky if I ever use EMIRATES again !!!!!!!!"
149,Fly Qatar Airways instead. Dreadfull levels of customer service. Keep getting told to contact a different department all the time.Now flying old Boeing 777's instead of the A380 so dont book twin seat on upper deck as they can change plane and you end up paying £65 per seat for the upgrade and then get put on a grotty knackered old 777  and no refund.
150,Moody check in agent at Heathrow! No smile just like you was a burden for checking in! The plane itself to UAE the A380 is ok seats and interior could do with a upgrade all feels outdated! Movie choice well if your not a frequent flyer then you will find something. The return journey we was 1kg over at UAE but they wouldn’t allow it unless we paid I stated we had no hand luggage as we could have brought 2 x carry on cases at 20kg combined approx anyway we carried the excessive 1kg out of case.
151,"Two years ago I booked with Emirates for the first time to travel to Brisbane using points that I had accumulated with American Express and transferred to Emirates specifically to use as part payment of my fare. The flight was cancelled due to Covid and my portion of the fare that was paid for by credit card was reimbursed.  When I have asked on numerous occasions if I could have my points reimbursed also, so as to complete the full reimbursement for the flight they had cancelled, I am given the response that it is not part of their policy.  Neither was a refund at the time, but they made it policy. I have written and contested numerous times but am met with a robotic and arrogant response that;""once Points are converted, reversal will not be accepted. I wish to confirm that our decision is final. This may not be the outcome you expected but I won’t be able to help you further in this matter.""As they were able to receive my points from American Express, I do not see why they technically cannot be redirected back there. They are my points but they have taken ownership of them. I had chosen them because of their customer service reviews.  This whole experience has me going to another competitor for my next journey. I will never fly with them in future after being treated in this way. There are 93,000 of my points sitting with them and that is not an insignificant amount."
152,"Recently flew Manchester - Dubai - Male and return journey. First time flying Emirates after previously flying with Qatar and Etihad. A380 was an experience, seats were comfortable enough in economy and entertainment provided was good. Service on board however was pretty dire, especially on the return journey. There were three male and one female cabin crew visible in our section, and she was running around like a headless chicken trying her best to keep us all fed and watered while the blokes stood around having a chat. Might has well have been cardboard cut outs.I've flown with loads of airlines, budget ones and Emirates has been the one that's been the biggest let down unfortunately."
153,"Recently travelled economy from MAN-DXB-MNL and back. Uneventful. Nothing went wrong, no delays."
154,"Crooks, criminals, parasites.Stole my money, stole my life from me and left me stranded in a foreign country as a bum on brink of suicide. Charged me for deportation, which the Spanish pr icks said would be for free, otherwise they wouldn't return my passport. Damaged my bag, refuse to even compensate that. And you have to wait for 40 minutes on phone to speak to a human, who will most probably transfer you to another person for another 40 minutes so that you hang up."
155,Poor service. Kept me waiting from 6 to 9pm didnt let my husband bpard to go see his mum in critical conditionIncorrcet info on site about covid vacc
156,I have just returned from Dubai and both flights were well managed.The pilots were fantastic and flew the A380 beautifully.Thank you pilotsAll went smoothly and the food and entertainment are precisely what I paid for .My economy seat was comfortable and spacious.Would have been a 5 if more water offered as when you wear a mask you do get very dry .Well done guys.
157,"I always fly with Emirates BUT in 2019 i booked to  fly   March 2020 of course this couldnt happen , i kept getting links to change  flight  so i followed the links  changed flight  to later 2020  not realising  i was being charged £200 ,i got straight onto them ,they said if i want the £200  back straight away it would cancel my flight but if i left it till after  my flight i would get it back ,well after 5 flight changes i have finally had my holiday  got back in April ,i have been trying to get  that money  back ,i filled in the forms  but it comes up if cancelled  before  March 7th 2020  no refund ,but i changed it 14th March ,i send in the feedback forms  get another (no reply) email telling me to fill the form in ,im going round in circles here ,i have phoned but they say it can't be done  over  phone surely something can be done i know its  2 yrs later but its not right,i even have the email that says  my refund  has been approved but nowhere to claim it"
158,"We flew Emirates on EK019 DBX-MAN on Mon 2nd May and the service was terrible - we were sat near the back and it took over 2.5 hours before we were even offered a drink. We had paid for seat selection but that was a total waste of money as it made no difference. After the meal service I asked was there going to be tea and coffee served. They said no hot drinks would be serve due to likely turbulence - which never happened. Then 30 mins later they came round with tea and coffee. I have never known service so slow.NEVER PAY FOR SEAT SELECTION AT THE REAR - WASTE OF MONEY!!!By the time the meal service came to us they had run out and only had 1 option. We had paid for the seat but others who hadn’t paid and were allocated seats by the system got better service. When we got on board we had asked if we could change seats but the staff were unhelpful. They laughed at us. The guy at check had tried his best to get us better seats but his supervisor didn’t answer the phone, He said tell the staff on board we had paid for seats and they would help. What a waste of time that was. The staff didn’t want to know.Then half way through the flight the guy next to us in the window seat became ill. He was being violently sick. Again the staff were unhelpful - they gave him a Rennie indigestion tablet!! We suggested they find him a better seat - eg aisle by the toilets but they said there were none. Poor guy was still being sick. There were 2 empty rows at the back reserved for staff ‘rest’ on what was only a 7 hour flight!!. After much insistence from us one of the cabin crew said the guy could move there once the curtain was removed for staff resting. This only happened 1 hour before landing.The staff were unhelpful, unsympathetic and generally acted in a superior manner. They have no concept of the term ‘customer service’."
159,Baggage went missing and wasn’t returned for 5 weeks. When it was returned 90% of contents were missing- stolen. Contacted Emirates- no reply which is normal for their customer services. Eventually got a curt and arrogant reply stating they would give us 50 dollars for 3 days allowance as we hadn’t reported the lost baggage!!! This appears to be a common problem with Emirates from reading other reviews . Disgusting and unacceptable that you cannot put your baggage on an Emirates flight without the contents being stolen without the company giving a damn. We are now taking legal action. Anyone else who has lost or had baggage stolen please contact so we can do a group action against this disgusting disrespectful company.
160,"The airport on arrival doesn’t have allocated checking per destination, everyone to all destinations checkin together. We waisted 3 hours checkin to then having to run to boarding. Food is very average on flight and the tv screen has no dim and when dark this is piercing on the eye. Bad airline. Won’t use again"
161,"I don't have idea to give even 1 Star this is totally rubbish service and disappointed , I just asked cup of water it's doesn't come, the assistant said I have to finished my work first. Then I do 🤮  what a disgusting, Dubai to uk"
162,"Used Emirates for the 1st time and must admit I was quite disappointed, 1st leg from Birmingham to Dubai was terrible, service on board was awful not sure what the flight attendants were doing but didn't want to come round with any drinks after the food was served, even pressed the help button but after an hour gave up and went thirsty, was exactly the same on the return from dubai to Birmingham.The second half of the journey from Dubai to Bangkok was much better and flight attendants seemed much better.After all the issues I had with their 'Customer Service' I would be surprised if I use again."
163,"My son 14 years old was travelling from Mumbai to Birmingham. Yesterday he has received unacceptable, disgusting service at Mumbai airport on the #Emirates counter by your staff(Jelina). They don't understand a kid travelling alone and how to behave with the kids. He was carrying allowable baggage of 28kg suitcase, 7kg cabin bag and 1 laptop bag but she has refused to accept the baggage by saying either you put laptop bag into cabin bag or pay Rs.13200.  He spent 45-50min just rearranging baggage finally she accepted the bags. You must be considerate when a kid is alone and again at security check they asked to remove the laptop bag from the cabin bag so how your staff is providing advice and how the customer is suffering on that. The behaviour of your staff Jelina was completely rude and I  was listening over the phone for 30mins. I was guiding him from the UK as no choice was available.I am truly disappointed with this scenario and unacceptable service from the emirates. My son was feared for all this nonsense and mental tortureI have raised a formal complaint but no response from Emirates."
164,"I used to give 5 star for all emirates airlines product and services, however after covid where the ainrlines start reducing the staff, the call center is very very difficult to get in touch even you are a gold member."
165,"Horrible service and then I mean customer support.No way to reach this airline, not by phone, email or chat"
166,"Amazing airline, love the airplanes especially the a380 (I'm an avgeek haha). With the cameras they have on the plane you're able to see how the plane takes off, flies and land from different perspectives! However, on a flight from Dubai-Jakarta I was the only one without a meal. They gave me Toblerone chocolate as an alternative. You can tell I was not full after some chocolate since I was on a 16hr journey. Most of the crew are not fluent in English and so am I, but that can be a problem if there is a bigger problem than just ''I don't have any food''."
167,"Great experience for me first time using Emirates to get from Stockholm to Dubai and back.The cabin crew to Dubai were fantastic with great service even in economy. Back to Stockholm the cabin crew were great and friendly. Boarding and getting off worked great. I could see that the cabin crews always put on a smile underneath their masks.Check-in online worked great and seat assignments worked perfectly for me. But other people don't seem to understand that they have to pay for certain special seat assignments, there were complaints during boarding that families were not seated together. These people need to learn how to fix that themselves with online check-in.I feel that the complaint here on trustpilot are unfair because they cause some of these problems by their own. They should educate themselves how to use the excellent online service of Emirates.I will definitely travel with Emirates in the future."
168,"Very very bed experience, by Emirates, one of my bag got fully broke so they gave me back only some items in a plastic bag, many items are damaged and many are lost. Online lost baggage claim process is very complicated and time consuming. My husband spent almost 10-15 hrs in last month to get the money for lost and damaged items.  I had to give them bill for all lost and damaged items. I don’t have all the bills and many items are very expensive ($ 500-600). The one I bought from India,  which is hand worked clothes and my tailer gave me bill which is hand written which is very common in India. I bought whole kitchen set brand new that bill is also they gave me hand written too. Those kind of bill they don’t consider for baggage lost claim. My claim was more then $1500 but they are saying they will give me only $311. I don’t have bill for bag so they are not going to give my money for bag too. I have been traveling to India from years via air india. First time I used Emirates and this happened. I am now very frustrated  by calling them again and again. I am not going to travel by Emirates again.Never again."
169,Ek 414 was diverted to melbourne due to sydney airport curfew not bad weather. You should have not left Dubai if you knew you will reach after 11 pm. You let my mother including all passengers in Melbourne airport without any help on chairs for more than 12 hours.I had to book on my own a flight from Melbourne to Sydney and paid it for it to bring her back.Shame on you. Totally unacceptable
170,"We recently returned from a holiday which included, amongst others, FOUR Emirates flights connecting Dubai, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and London.On EVERY flight we complied 100% with the requiremennts of each destination with regards to Covid travel requirements, the two of us being ""Recovered"" patients.In brief, despite arriving thee and a half hours before the flight departed, we were REFUSED permission to check-in. NOT ONE member of the Emirates team at LHR, knew of flight requirements for Sri Lanka, (which had been unchanged for AT LEAST 6 weeks), NOR THE EMIRATES POLICY  ITSELF, for passengers transitting through  Dubai. (This had changed eleven days before departure, and was CLEARLY stated on EMIRATES WEBSITE). NOT ONE of Emirates personnel was aware of this! (Obviously the management team behind the scenes, who FAILED to make themselves known AT ANY TIME, had no idea either)Eventually, a very apologetic assistant came running up to us just one hour before departure, saying ""Soorry, sorry, sorry....you were right"". We were then hurriedly checked in, only to be REFUSED entrance through security as BOTH boarding cards WERE IN THE SAME NAME!This still causes my stomach to turn at the recollection!Having returned from holiday  I quite naturally wanted to take this totally UNPROFESSIONAL  and UNACCEPTABLE  experience up with the company, and submitted a formal complaint with a FULL explanation of what went wrong as a direct result of Emirates lack of knowledge and unprofessional  conduct.Having chased a response after over two weeks, I received a response from Emirates customer services:Stating INCORRECT facts about their own company policy regarding transiting passengers. It also FAILED COMPLETELY to address the issues raised in the formal complaint.I await a response from Emirates how to escalate this incident which, quite frankly, I'd rather completely forget! I cannot believe the pathetic, unprofessional and ill-disciplined practices in place at this airliine. My advice to anyone considering flight options is AVOID EMIRATES AT ALL COSTS."
171,"Awful experience. Flight was good but admin atrocious. Found out when I tried to check in 2 days before I flew that they'd cancelled my tickets saying Barclaycard had requested the money back. Heartbroken, was off with my daughter to see my son in Dubai where he was working, just for 3 days and he'd made so many plans. Begged them to sort it, and they wanted to charge me nearly 3 times as much, then after I begged and cried, particularly as nobody had thought to tell me about this until I rang about the check in online. They then sold me my original tickets back, same ticket numbers, same seat numbers for same price I paid 3 weeks earlier. Rang Barclaycard who said they hadn't requested anything back and my balance was still on my card. So I paid twice! Went on the trip, great staff and flight, so now trying to sort it out back home. No sense in any of the emails. Now they say they can find the first payment but not the second. Hoping Barclaycard can claim the first payment back, but for the stress caused I would say don't touch them with a bargepole!!"
172,Airbus A380 could carry this airline into 5* remit. If only they’d retire the Boeing 777 entirely.
173,"Flown Emirates numerous times but since Covid-19 , Emirates customer service is a joke , paid for twin seats , used chewing gum left in old waste bag which was not emptied , old lurpak on floor , emailed emirates was not happy they said they will let the cleaners know to clean better next time nothing about my service overall how they can compensate for it , flight prices are ridiculously overpriced with bad customer service , emirates service has gone downhill."
174,Best airline ever ! Best economy class ever ! Very friendly cabine crew. I am looking forward to fly again.
175,"I have extended Emirates DG3L86 flights to Thailand for free use /book anytime until 05.03.23 , Emirates emailed me confirming all tickets are extended on their end  and asked me to make sure I email wedoflights /Etravel VHX0GI asking to do same on their end as airline and travel agent use different booking platforms , Immediately after receiving this from Emirates airline I emailed travel agency to extend my flights around april 21 to request extension  in to 2022/23 , I actually emailed this request 3 times April September November 2021  to be sure they have done all correctly as per Emirates airline  advise.All   confirmed back and none of the agents did this  , I only found out yesterday 21.03.22  as I emailed wedoflights /etravel  to book a trip for Feb  23 was told my tickets expired  !!!, no longer valid !!! so I rang emirates to enquire since I have an email confirming from the airline that my tickets are extended . Airline told me that Wedoflight /etravel failed to inform them to extend my tickets!!!!!!! and the ticket cannot be used, utterly rubbish of the company 3 emails , 3 confirmation , 3 agents involved none of them done it , will never book with them all correspondence written to me have at no point simple apologies we screwed up we sorry we try to fix it  So depressed at the moment with this company.  My orginaly ticket was booked on 02.03.20 and extended by the airline until 05.03.23 becose of the incompetence of wedoflights/etravel I lost this  on the top of that was asked to pay additional fee of £50 to cover administration cost I refused this , how can you even ask people to pay extra fees for all your mistakes , who ever have extended ticket with wedoflight  /etravel becarfull and better enquire to have something in writing as same will probably happens to you and you will looos your trip, ah ye sorry forgot I emailed 3 times requesting this extention and thay failed to do this !!!!My family has been with Emirates for the last 8 years either booking directly or through a travel agency but when I rang  Emirates airline to seek help none of the agents was willing to do anything to help me with this , that's what you get for trusting in the brand !!!! , for keeping ticket open past 2.5 years and not demanding  refund when the Emirates airline was on the knees during the Covid outbreak , nor me nor my kids or wife we choose Emirates for our travel was so easy for the agents to just brush me off with this is not our problem , this is agency problem , let me tell you that it is your problem as well you have emailed me in April 2021 confirming my tickets are extended and now not accepting my ple to extend my ticket and use for dates in feb 2023"
176,"I booked an Emirates Holiday to Dubai and expected to receive a booking confirmation straight away.  It’s been over a week and I still have no booking confirmation & therefore no booking reference.  I can’t get hold of customer service on the phone, Whatsapp or Messenger.   I will now try and get my money back with my credit card company & will never use Emirates again."
177,BUYER BEWARE of 'hold my fare' function...By clicking this option Emirates have taken x 2 of the full fare. I've had to put in for a refund which they claim will take 15 working day. Terrible service.
178,"We booked two flights from Manchester to Dubai.  Emirates emails encouraged us to look up their Covid advice.  As the Covid rules were constantly changing we did this a number of times hoping the need to have PCR tests would be dropped.  Every time we went to the Emirates Covid advice page it said in the first paragraph all passengers travelling to Dubai (including GCC people) should have documented negative PCR tests done within 72 hours of flying.  We eventually arranged our PCR tests accordingly, got all the documentation together, went to the airport and were refused boardind on the grounds that our PCR tests were out of date.  The web page was wrong.  For UK passengers it was 48 hours but you had to read further down the web page to pick this up.  The first paragraph was simply wrong and grossly misleading. I protested at the check-in desk but was dealt with harshly.  Apparently a lot of passengers were falling foul of the same thing so they had a standard brutal line to take.We went across to Terminal 2 to have some more PCR tests done.  On getting the results we could not enter our booking because of the No Show.  We eventually managed to speak to someone on the booking line 10,000 miles away down a drainpipe to be told the extra costs of the  night flight would be £960.  This was the camel's straw.  Thoroughly stressed out and angry we aborted and caught a £130 taxi home.At home we decided we still wanted to go on holiday so we booked some more flights the following day at an extra, now cost of £1048.  I submitted a complaint and basically was given short drift, Emirates saying all passengers are responsible for the accuracy of their travel documents.  Article 13 in the Ts and Cs.  I agree with that but aren't Emirates responsable for the quality and correctness of their Covid advice?We've travelled with Emirates dozens of times over the years and at one time were Silver Members.  But this experience leaves a very bad taste in our mouths. When Emirates gets things wrong it should be big enough to admit it, and deal with it.  Very unimpressed.But having gone throught this experience I can say there is a reality gap in their customer service.  It simply doesn't exist.  There is no formal complaints procedure detailing the process, how to appeal and escalate, who to write to where.  You can only communicate through their half-baked web system which is limited in characters and what you type disppears off the top of the small screen box you are offered.  The whole thing is designed to prevent you complaining, or to obstruct you.  They really are not interested in looking at what goes wrong and how they can improve.  They are too quick to quote the Ts and Cs.  Third world standards I am afraid."
179,"I feel it has smth to do that I’m Ukrainian,  have issues with 2 flights and a piece of baggage i Have paid for missing , while I’ve been trying to escape the WAR .  Think before you book, this company supports terrorists"
180,"I sent the airline a serious complaint in respect to health and safety. During my flight from London to Dubai I had an adverse reaction to the food and subsequently got food poisoning. I had to visit the Dr at Dubai airport to check my status and sign-off on my ability to take the transit flight. For an airline which is consider as one of the best, I am shocked by my experience. Another family friend who took a similar flight days earlier also became ill and I see various complaints online in respect to the issue. In response the airline implied it could have been caused before the flight, apparently no one else reported similar issues and feel free to contact them about any other issue. Genuinely horrified."
181,"Been trying to ring for two days now to change a booking urgently. Yesterday over two hours with no success and today a record of over 3hrs and still no success. Emailed and was told someone would contact us and still nothing, how do we speak to someone?Mrs Senior"
182,"I have a flight in a week and I have been trying to contact customer service I am flying in two weeks, I was on golds for 2hrs 45 min, no one picked up, I emailed got no response, sent a message on the emirates watsapp number and sent a message on Twitter no response. The is a bottom tier airline. I will never fly with them again, they are no different to low cost airlines. They charge so much and yet they don’t have a customer service department."
183,"Emirates Very rude staff at Sydney intl. Dep Terminal, I am travelling with Emirates for last 15 years+ never had these kind of behaviours from their staff members. I always travel long haul flights 2-3times every year. In last two months I experienced while boarding that staff members are really rude and stressed out at Sydney intl. airport.First time in January 2022, I even complained to her supervisor that your staff member is talking very rudely is she ok, on which he apologised and did boarding on his own. Same thing happened in Feb 2022 where I ignored in complaining to her supervisor  because I knew nothing will happen. So, yeah Never going to use this airline again!I recommend to use alternate options if you can as there are many better airlines I chose Etihad."
184,"Needed to move our holiday booking dates due to illness, was on hold to the customer services line for over 4 hours and when I finally got through, the travel consultant was rude, irritable and unhelpful. Initially was told the original booking would need to be paid and claimed back by insurance and that it's ""unheard of that bookings are moved"" without paying the full cancellation costs. I was then told an option may be to speak directly with the hotel provider to ask if they can move the hotel booking, and call the Emirates customer service back on the same number (with another 4 hour wait...) afterwards...Terrible and unhelpful service from Emirates vs my experience with other providers such as British Airways, Virgin, Tui and TrailFinders. As someone who enjoys 'premium' holidays I'll be avoiding them in the future"
185,I would recommend never fly with Emirates.
186,"Absolutely horrendous journey from Melbourne to Manchester. We paid quite a lot extra,for extra legroom seats…..never ever again! People saw our space, at the bulkhead or galleys,  as their exercise area or gym. On the first leg 14 hours, the woman behind decided to put her bare feet on to our arm rest! Emirates should travel in these seats and see that asking more money for them is robbery."
187,"I have tried multiple times to book a multi centre flights last night, and due to the website technical error I couldn't, I have also received an email from Emirates stating that. Today when I went back to book the same flights, the price was way higher, so to save some money I had to book a different flight, and despite it, the total final price was still higher than the one I had last night.I have contacted the Emirates chat, and the operator said he could not help at all... how shame, at least Emirates should apply a small discount when a customer can actually show the proof he/she was booking it earlier on and missed it for the Emirates fault! This is very disappointing and definitely not expected for a high class company!"
188,we fly with emirtates from copenhagen to nairobi and return. but our return flight goy canceld. and we went there office we got new ticket to fly again after 7 days. and to days after out ticket got canceld. and the same game again. and the workers so rude. and when you call no help at all. so we had to buy new ticket with another company to fly back home. so it was the last time am flying with the company.
189,You fly Emirates you support Russian invasion of Ukraine!!!
190,"What a sxxt airline and what a shxxy service, I missed my connecting flight due to heavy fog from my departing city. And they booked me in a flight after 14 hours and made me wait in Dubai airport for those long 14 plus hours with only 1 meal voucher in general waiting area, where I had to stay awake for 36 hours in total journey. Very sxxxy, rude and unhelpful staff at Dubai airport departures. Don't listen to you and become your bosses like behaviour. They offered passengers with British passport a free upgrade to business class, wherever they treated pakistan and Indian passport holders like sxxt and did not compensated them for any hotel or upgrade to business class, which completely unfair and very unethical. Wouldn't even give them 1 star. When I made a complaint about it, their answer was very similar to of those disgusting staff in Dubai airport. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Avoid these axxhxxxs."
191,"I was flying emirates out of Houston on 29th November 2021 and i had purchased extra luggage. When i got there i was told it was per piece not per KG and i had to pay more. i agreed and tried to give them cash, they refused and insisted that i must pay by credit card which i did not have, eventually an argument ensued and their assistant mgr Jason Auguste came there and instead of resolving the conflict, he told me not to board the flight and i left. I have been asking for my refund from Emirates and they said i did not meet their conditions of carriage because of an argument. At first they told me i could not fly Emirates anymore but that was false because i flew them to Glasgow on the 13th Of December 2021 and returned on the 24th of January 2022. I was perplexed and i have been asking for my refund and they provided no proof whatsoever to back up their claims. They just cannot keep my USD 3500 and not refund or re-issue the ticket. I am still asking for my money or a new ticket from Emirates. Customer Affairs asked me to contact their security which i did and the security said it had nothing to do with them. They were essentially giving me the run around instead of being professional. Samantha asked me to go ahead and claim a refund for the unused sector which i did but was denied, i have sent her multiple mails and she does not respond to emails or calls to their 04-7084837 number. Samantha D'souza is playing hide and seek with my money. Emirates customer affairs are extremely unprofessional and need to refund my money or issue a new ticket. Emirates is not a good airline and their service is sub-par at best. I just want my money back."
192,Be every careful! There service is below -1 ster! They have hidden charges and cost.
193,Website doesn't work. Try contacting them is a joke - very frustrating. Take 5 days to respond to emails. Lie in chat and are a walking disaster. I used to be a Gold Flyer with them - now I just want my refund back so I NEVER have to fly with these jokes again.
194,"My flight was cancelled twice at less than 48 hours notice. I eventually received a refund from my travel agent, but i had incurred extra costs of PCR tests, onwards flights and rescheduling of work, costing me hundreds of pounds. Emirates are refusing to accept any responsibility. It turns out this route had been cancelled for weeks but they never told us until less than 2 days before, which is why we incurred the additional costs to us. I hold Emirates responsible for this."
195,"We  have  had an absolutely atrocious experience with emirtes staff at duabi airport. 2.5 hours before my flight . me and my friends are booked tickets together and we have to put our baggage together (before itself we calculated or total weight and we paid the extra for our baggage before the boarding ) we shown all the details to emirates staff. But she never mind at all saying that we need to put spate baggage only family member can put combined bag. She claimed 280AED even we have 30kg extra. Then they said to pay cash counter. Two three time send back from cash counter and boarding counter. why you people  are unwilling to help us even the right way of guide to do what. We are treated like we are nothing finally they given boarding  pass which is in different name and again I came back and get my boarding pass for this rounded two times finally I went into the flight in last minutes with my friends which we rush to getYou are in customer service………….  but there is no customer service  due to lack of basic knowledge and service given by emirates staff. Had your staff even been remotely aware of the operations in the rest of the airport, I wouldn’t have missed my flight. Management team is not looking anythingHello boss you are not giving free service kindly think about it The most bad and cheater airline . They have unfear rules . The staff very bad attitude. If you ask question you will be in trouble and guilty. No respect and they don't care manager and they don't care anything . There is supervisor in dubai airport is screaming to customer like we came to his house. He almost"
196,STOP 🛑 treating South Africa as 4th world country The existing buisiness JNB lounge is tardy old world and out of date to the say the least 😫To add insult to injury the temp lounge currently being utilised by Emirates at ORT is A 3rd world Dump .   I’ve just been offered breakfast 🍳 from a microwave 🤷🏻‍♂️What the Hell 😳 Emirates catch a wake Next time I will rather pay the Extra and fly Qatar 🇶🇦 Airways !!!  Really poor and disappointing show Emirates !
197,"I have just had an absolutely atrocious experience with your staff at Zurich airport. I arrive and buy my ticket 2.5 hours before my flight and see that I need a new pcr test before I depart. Your staff then inform me that it’s takes 24 hours to get the result of a pcr test and that they are unwilling to help me even rebook the ticket I had moments ago bought. After I was carelessly turned away in tears, I soon after find out from passersby outside that it only takes 45 minutes to get the result of a pcr test in Zurich airport (which I then rush to get). I ultimately end up missing my flight due to the gross incompetence, lack of basic knowledge and service by emirates staff. Had your staff even been remotely aware of the operations in the rest of the airport, I wouldn’t have missed my flight and wasted 1381.45 CHF all the while I have family members in hospital waiting for me."
198,The most bad and cheater airline . They have unfear rules . The staff very bad attitude. If you ask question you will be in trouble and guilty. No respect and they don't care manager or police they don't care anything . There is supervisor name omar in  tunisia airport is screaming to customer like we came to his house . He almost hit me beceause I told him I will complain about you . That's shame and poor . Even free I will never travelle with emirats airline .
199,Flew with my family to Dubai! The staff were extremely polite and friendly!
200,Try calling Emirates to change a ticket or cancel and booking and you will be surprised that you can talk to a human being within a short period..I wouldn't bother with BA or virgin..
201,Terrible organisation. Lost my luggage and have called numerous times and still do not have my luggage. This since December. Avoid at all cost. I’d give a minus rating if possible.
202,"Disgraceful overrated company, everything about it is so god damn frustrating, don't fall for their PR moves, there is far better service elsewhere at a much lower cost! This reproduction of an airline is a miserable attempt at wanting people's money that is all, nothing about it is refined or glamorous, this is a depressing place."
203,Excellent customer service by Vivian. He provided all the information I was looking for. He was Very patient and helpful answered all of my questions without any hesitation. Very polite and approachable. Thank you vivian. You are making a difference.
204,"We had been giftred a holiday in Dubai so booked through Emirates. After recieving their terms and conditions it clearly states that we needed to take a PCR test at least 48hrs from our travel date.As we flew on a Monday we took our tests on the Saturday afternoon.On arriving at Newcastle airport we went to the desk of a very ugly,ignorant and obnoxious blonde witch.We handed over all our required documents  and the witch with her glorious customer services skills said our PCR tests were out of date which i replied they are not and well within the required date, she then said its TIME and as the flight takes off at 20:10 and our tests were taken at 16:00 on the Saturday we were out of date by 4hrs.A total and utter disgrace as i reiterated Emirates rules as it clearly states Date..not time.The witch wasnt having it so went to her supervisor who said she was correct. Her actions then was to fist pump in the air then high five with all her colleagues.The supervisor then proudly explains that he prevented people boarding who were 30 mins out of time.The staff here are the most ignorant, obnoxious and uncompassionate i have ever met.We were sent to get another PCR test at £100 each but our flights were cancelled until the Wednesday. The most annoying part of this is when we eventually got away to Dubai on arrival at the airport you are shepherded to a free PCR zone ran by Emirates , you take a test and when exiting through immigration they do not ask for the PCR you took in the UK. Those staff at Newcastle airport should be sacked and only trained compassionate people should be employed as they are the most disgusting people i have ever witnessed.So if from the North East and you want to go to Dubai, try another airport or another agent, stay well clear of the thieving, disgusting Emirates staff."
205,Costumer services very bad nobody answer the call never fly again with Emirates heard so many good things about them but it all scam.
206,"Very very roude and arrogant staff, don't helf passengers with any paperworkWe had no idea what required documents we need for travelling to India as the travel rules changed so much due to covid restrictions, Emirates website had no information on the app or website, useless company and staff, I will never use this flight again, we had to buy another ticket for next day flightVery very disappointed"
207,"We flew with Emirates, Business Class from the UK, for a once in a lifetime holiday in Kenya last December. While on holiday in Kenya, Emirates suspended all flights from Kenya to Dubai. We had to book 2 single business class tickets with BA to get home. Once home we applied for a refund to Emirates for the return tickets that they canceled. The refund we received was less than half the price of the flights from Kenya to the UK, which Emirates cancelled. Emirates took the total price of our return ticket and deducted the cost of two single flights from the UK to Kenya from this - as single tickets are much more expensive the balance due to us was reduced by £1030!!!. So Emirates cancel your flight, cause you stress on holiday and they steal £1030 pounds by stating that you took a single flight. NEVER EVER TRUST THIS AIRLINE. I have written to their CEO Tim Cooke, cut up my Platinum Skywards card and told them I nor my family, friends or business will ever use them again."
208,"Airlines must be contactable. It's a simple requirement. If you fired too many staff during Covid you need to hire new staff to replace those. Leaving an automated response that states you no longer answer the phone simply is unacceptable. Appalling. 10 years ago Emirates were excellent, but they ruined their reward card system after partnering with Qantas, and now this."
209,Awful airline! I paid for an upgrade then they put me in economy and refused to refund me! They would not let me get on the flight or use my upgrade ticket on the next. Total scam!
210,"Very poor service at airport, got pcr -ve in hand still force me to do another on airport as they are not accepting what i got,they off board me with no genuine reason and cancel my flight, no clear communication or handling, im regreting to book flight with emirates as of absolute poor serice, emirates let me in a big stress and extra cost for another pcr with no reason, i advise other not to trust this airline, better to pay extra and travel with other, who atleast care you, i am definatly considering legal action too,"
211,"I have always been happy with Emirates flights, and inflight service and entertainment. On this occasion, booking flights direct with Emirates after Gotogate let us down showed their great service when things go wrong. I was able to reach customer service using their London service centre number to book flights that met the Thai embassy requirements to Koh Samui. Then we unfortunately had to cancel due to suspension of the Thai Pass. It was easy, filled out a 5 min online form, immediate acknowledgment, refund processed and back in my account in 4 working days, although the email states up to 15 days. In comparison, I am still emailing Gotogate with no progress on my first set of cancelled flights."
212,"Emirates, you refused to let us take our business class flights that we had fully paid for because we were travelling through Dubai and missed the PCR test requirement by 2 hours.  You said there were no exceptions to this rule despite our pleading.  Then I read in the Sunday Times that the exact same thing happened to Jeremy Clarkson and his pleading worked as he was allowed to travel through Dubai.  Please compensate us  for the flight you did not allow us to take.  You are operating double standards."
213,"The customer service is simply not existent. I have to change my flight date because I tested positive to covid, however the website keeps prompting an error message and asks me to contact them directly. I have called them 15 times now, and NEVER managed to connect to an attendant.The live chat in their website is turned off due to ""high demand during those times"" - ironic how due to high demand they close communication channels, instead of doing the opposite. I paid three times the cost I used to pay before covid, and am getting this horrible service and poor excuses.Never got any response from the website feedback or email section.I've tried simply every possible way of managing that reserve and that's just impossible, this extremely frustrating.On another note, their pricing is extremely dodgy, to say the least.When looking at rescheduling the ticket, the fares are significantly higher than when looking at buying an exactly same new one. I've paid a premium fee for the flexible ticket, so I'd pay only for the fare difference, but then they simply pull one over by charging more to to tickets on the rescheduling page.And finally, their prices vary from user to user. I was browsing the flights together with my wife, each one using a different laptop. Exactly the same flight showed up to her with the cost of R$6,900 and to me $25,952, we were doing it at the same time, I even saved screen shots to prove how dodgy they are.Extremely disappointed, one would expect more from a company like Emirates after paying so much for tickets."
214,"I have booked my honeymoon to the Seychelles with emirates holidays. The holiday experience was suppose to be a once in a lifetime opportunity as my partner and I are business owners and we rarely get time to get away. I have had nothing but zero communication with the emirates team. I have tried everyday for 4 days!! waited on hold for over 2 hours and still got no where. Is anyone even working there? I have also sent an email to customer relations advising if I do not get a response I will cancel the honeymoon and book else where. Still no response. For such a big company and a very expensive holiday I would have expected abit more from them. If I do not get a response within 72 hours, I am afraid I will be cancelling my honeymoon with them.PLEASE CALL ME BACK OR ANSWER THE PHONE OR EMAILS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
215,How can you wait 5 hrs on the phone   for a customer services centre to answer  then the line goes dead unbelievable  i dont know what’s happened to Emirates but it’s gone down hill fast. They say you cannot ring until 3 weeks before your flight what happens to those of us who need tnt o speak to someone before that and yes i have used email and whatsapp but no response. For a company the size of Emirates they should have a decent IVR system that tells you where you are in the queue how long the wait is it’s not acceptable for them to take your money then just leave you with the stress of not being able to speak to a member of staff.  Does ANYONE from Emirates read these reviews … we will see as i need to speak to a person. No doubt will be on the phone for another 5 hrs tomorrow to no avail. After flying Emirates for 18 years i think it’s time to use an airline that cares for its customers 😡
216,"I booked through get a flight. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER USE THEY HAVE COMPLETELY PUT ME IN A VULNERABLE SITUATION AND NOT SOLVED ANY OF MY PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGHT ITS THEIR FAULT (CAROL WAS MY AGENT)! I originally booked flights for Pakistan in February 2021 for March/April 2021 and paid around £1200 for 4 tickets (2 adult, 1 child & 1 infant) due to the redlist Emirates were offering refunds or vouchers I was told if you get a refund £200 from each ticket will be deducted & that my best option was to go for the voucher as I would only pare the fare difference. September the redlist came to an end. I was checking online ticket prices again they were around £1600 I was expecting to pay around £400 on top of what I already paid. When I called and spoke to carol my agent the price she got back to me with was around another £1200 and that new ticket prices and voucher prices are different and that I can’t book the same class (even though it seemed like there was no difference in class as I was not getting anything extra) I felt stuck they already had my money and now I would have to pay the same amount again! So I Paid the amount and bought the tickets. I downloaded the Emirates app and noticed my the information the agent put in (our date of births) we’re all wrong. My infant who would now need a child seat was booked as she would turn 2 before her return flight was still booked as an infant!! HOW COULD THEY GET THIS WRONG WHEN THEN HAD THE INFORMATION FROM MY ORIGINAL BOOKING!!! I called emirates they same as I booked through an agent to call the agent. I called the agents they loads said she would get back to me by the end of the day. She called me back before 5 and said the BEST option is to take my outbound flight and before my return flight give them a call to see what they can do!!! I said I’m not willing to take that risk (WE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BOARD) why can’t you amend the error I understand I will have to pay extra for a child ticket!! She said that carol will be in tomorrow from 4 o’clock and will call. I said okay what about a refund I know Emirates have said I can get a full refund and travel agents will also offer this! She said around £75 will be deducted from each ticket but that’s not a definite amount I will have to get back to you about that! She said carol will call me tomorrow at 4 but again the best option is to take your outbound flight and call them. SHE STILL NEVER CALLED THE NEXT DAY!!! I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND OF THE £2400 I PAID!!!"
217,"Maybe a reaction via trustpilot….I have made a booking via the app. Paid 3000 euro’s……No email, no booking ref…nothing……No reaction on emails. You can only make a complain on the website if you have a booking reference…..Which I do not have :-)No whatsapp, you cannot reach them by phone……..Emirates……..what about your customer service?????"
218,"We booked a return flight for the December holidays. The flight there was ok, although the plane was not comfortable. But then, Emirates cancelled our flights back. No support to replace the flights, no assistance for overseas accommodation, no answer to emails. And no one answering the phone. Five weeks later, we still have not managed to get our money back for the flight that they cancelled."
219,Never have i seen a customer service go  down hill so fast there must be massive problems somewhere
220,"Poor customer service,very slow and unprofessional. On their website they put one information and when you get there will be big surprises. When I was coming back they cancel the flight and didn't provide hotel or anything. They gave me so much stress and never forget that. So much wasted money for vacation and this airline is good at it. Don't come to Dubai. Use American airlines only. Travel to Hawaii."
221,"they cancel my flight 24 hours before my departure I try to contact customer service with nobody to help me, they don't care about customers when I ask for a refund they give only$170 for a ticket price of $1186.00, worse airline ever"
222,"Emirates airlines are VERY! VERY! BAD ,i do not recommend it at all, the stress they put me through the financial stress , time everything, they have shown me through hard times they do not  care or have any respect for me or anyone els flying with them, I understand there is cancellation because of the big lie Covid! But at least tell us the flights are cancelled before we get to the airport, I am a frequent flyer with them they use to be good , they cancelled my flight from London to South Africa without me knowing, strange part is they were flying in that same day and hour they cancelled my flight, maybe it was they way to try and increase the ticket I bought many months ago before I flew, when I arrived to check in at the airport I was told I was not on the system, but the flight was still on for that day, than they said it's the getAflight agent  I booked with that cancelled, i than asked the agent, than they said there is nothing they can do about my ticket Emirates cancelled it, NO TRUTH FROM NO ONE, than they want out business , I'm waiting on my refund still, I'm supposed to fly back today 27th January, again no flights of Emirates are going out but I still have my ticket, no warning or notification from the airline nothing by email or a call to let me know. There was not even any Emirates staff to let people know or be there incase of help needed. 5star , not even one star. They truly disappointed me. I want my money back all of it. Emirates you lost allot of customers who cared for what you sold, I will never ever book with you again. Not even for free. I hope whatever you did to people will come back in your business. It's not right what you did. Do not fly Emirates, nothing amazing about them."
223,"I booked a connecting flight, went half way through it and then sent back to my original departure point, they didnt explain to me why, they did not refund my tickets, and they did not care about my time or money."
224,"Horrible experience. I had booked gluten free and they didn't understand what it was. Tried several times to contact them to enquire about why my allergy was missed. Also they asked us to pay £250 for a Covid test when randox was suitable requirement for entry. Poor staff training, and lack of attentiveness. No replies from them even after waiting 2 months."
225,Outstanding service up to now - have flown with them 6 times in 4 months and have been very happy.
226,"who do we normally call a thief ? ..... your company did not refund us our tickets money in full and since august 2021 we tried with email and many many calls, the last one today but no one replied or helped us with our issue. Today's call was made with an operator called ""Mouhamed"" who left me hanging on the phone for over 9 minutes waiting and the line had no sound and was dead but still connected to the customer service number, so I kept waiting until I hanged up. this is unprofessional and amator scam like behaviour and the whole experience is disappoiting and utterly disgusting...should you still refuse to help me after this review then I will find other means to get my voice heard and will complain to the appropriate authority!!!"
227,"I booked an emirates flight from Copenhagen to Ghana via Dubai between December and January. Sad to say, the only positive thing about the whole experience was their inflight entertainment. The flight to Ghana went somehow ok, though some flight attendants were been passively rude to passengers trying to use the bathroom. I managed to stay in my seat throughout the flight to avoid such incidence. Upon my arrival in Accra, on my way home, a family member informs me of emirates cancellation of all outgoing flights from Accra till further notice, this was then extended indefinitely 2 days after. Emirates sent no information or email whatsoever and I was relying on hearsay information on  social media and other news-outlets . I was scheduled on a return flight on the 14th of January with emirates and as of the 12th of January, there was still no information regarding resumption available whatsoever. I took it upon myself to call the customer service and the personnel at the other end had no helpful but yet contradicting information. He claimed flights were still operational from Ghana, which wasn't the case by the way. That's when i realised that its best to find a backup plan and thereby ended up paying close to a  $1000 for a return ticket with a different airline. I am so appalled that customer service is non existent with emirates, there was no information, no emails nothing. Needles to say, emirates lifted the travel ban on the 13th January, that was a day before my scheduled flight. I decided not to take the chance and flew out with Klm instead. I will never ever fly with emirates ever again even if its for free,"
228,Disgusting Online booking experienceI tried to book tickets twice and both transactions failed at payment. I was little concerned if amount was already deducted from my credit card. I don't find any contact number to confirm that. I gave up and booked a new ticket through qatar airways.Not sure why Emirates not investing on their website.

230,"Excellent customer service. I am an anxious flyer and get nervous when dealing with anything plane related. I always fly with Emirates but only needed to change flights a few days ago because of the South Africa flight suspension. So easy to do, staff incredibly helpful. Took minutes to reschedule and all the original COVID related terms and conditions still apply to my new dates."
231,Fantastic customer service and great value - always use them they also Honour Covid cancelaltions and unlike BA and others do not give a voucher and will change dates for up to two years if travel changes due to Covid.Flown with them 2 times in last 6 months - very reliable service with great connections around the world. Book online for great prices and via their own website which often has better prices than agents.
232,"My experience was very good. I tried Emirates a few times and also many other airlines (tens of) and actually Emirates was the best one for me. Good service, good food on board, things just go well. I recommend as good airline from my experience."
233,"THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER COME ACROSS!!! IVE BEEN TRYING FOR A WEEK TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SOMEONE TO CHANGE MY APRIL HOLIDAY. IVE BEEN ON HOLD OVER THE PAST WEEK FOR HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AND STILL NO ANSWER!!!! IVE EMAILED, WHATS APP, FACEBOOK MESSAGES AND STILL NO HELP FROM ANYONE!!! ABSOLUTLEY FUMING!!!!! I WILL NEVER USE THEM EVER AGAIN!!!!!"
234,"I was really looking forward to flying with Emirates, due to its excellent reputation - now I have no idea how they got it.At first they delayed our connecting flight for 7 hours, so we had to rebook also the first flight which resulted in us not sitting together, as the plane was fully booked.When we were already enjoying our holiday they cancelled our return flight for no good reason and did not even offer any help on how to get back home.They are referring to some weird policy, that actually does not exist. The Since Emirates was not flying this route anymore, we had to book another airline short-term, which resulted in very high costs for us.I have been in contact with Emirates since then, but nothing satisfying has come up so far. However I will definitely take this issue to our lawyer and try to get as much money back as possible.They are truly horrible and I will not fly with them again!"
235,"Emirates are selling tickets that they have cancelled routes on and using covid restrictions for reason to cancel, They cannot use Covid restrictions as excuse for cancelling if those restrictions were already in place when selling tickets! This means it’s within their control to cancel flights as already know they are cancelled!! This is just an excuse to try and get round EU261/2004 and also hold passenger money their side to gain interest from before refunding, which by credit card legally is 7 days, but Emirates taking weeks into months to refund- this is to help them recoup from Pandemic- Great Customer Service Emirates!!!!!  My flight today has been cancelled from MAN to DUR as no flights from DXB to DUR going, yet they will reroute through to JNB and make me pay for own flight from JNB to DUR, as they did with my partner that went out on 7th,  issue then is they won’t fly you back on return as not operating flights back to DXB from South Africa-However they not telling you that when you book!  So they will take you part way and then dump you. Again Great Customer Service Emirates!!! My partner was not informed when he checked in on 7th they won’t be bringing him back on 29th, so now he has to either be placed on next available flight, which funnily they are selling 2 days later even though will cancel again, or take a partial refund which is less than 1/4 of ticket price and will have to wait for that refund until Emirates have got enough interest from it in their bank, meanwhile we have to fork out another ticket with British Airways to ensure he gets home! I have made official complaint to Emirates, but just like their refunds…. This is delayed, can take up to 60 days to respond to a complaint… Oh Yes, That’s Emirates Customer Service Standards! Disgraceful!"
236,Had worst Inflight experience from Dubai to London flight. Raised a complaint for the racist and arrogant behaviour of the crew member to Emirates customer support. Worst of all is the way the person providing the response to the complaint mentioned all the actions of their crew members were justified and I am just left with a negative impression on this occasion.All I wanted was a fair review of the complaint and a sincere apology and not some random miles. Very pathetic response for a customer using their airlines for last 12 years
237,"On my first flight I paid for an upgrade to business class. On board the seat was damaged, and many options such the mobile charger weren’t working. The hostess solved the issue for the charger without taking care of other matters related to the seat that made me uncomfortable, despite the face the fact the I was insisting because I couldn’t sleep during the whole flight. On the return flight. Again I wanted to upgrade to business class but there were  no seats. So I asked the check-in desk to give me an exist seat instead they assured me that I will get on as a gesture since I couldn’t have the upgrade.on board I discovered that I was given a normal seat so after the plane took off, I found an empty exist seat. So I sat there then the hostess came to me and asked me to pay an extra fee equivalent to the price of the round trip trip to get that seat. I asked to talk to the supervisor to explain this disruption that I’m getting for the lack of Coordination between the desk nd on board crew, she claimed that she was on charge and still I have to pay this extra charge.so I paid and asked for a form to submit my complain. She refused to give this form and told me in impolite way that if I have any problem then I can complain through emirates website. So when I paid the first time she said that it didn’t go through and asked me to repeat the payment twice after without giving any prove the rejection of the first 2 payments. However despite the horrible experience during both flight I found myself paying  worthless upgrade in addition to 3 times extra fee for an empty exist seat that was guaranteed to me as a gesture after the first disappointment ( upgrade). I was assured that I will be refunded the extra charge in 24 hours and it’s been 4 days since then without any refund or follow up. Moreover, I tried to submit complaint and explain the situation to emirates website but it doesn’t seem to be adapted to such complaint. Lastly, I can tell that I have been flying with many airlines worldwide including low cost ones for short journeys but I never ad such a horrible  experience as  I had with Emirates and their impolite and undertrained crew."
238,"terrible customer service. everywhere at airport, in plane or online, their customer service is absent. i had a very bad experience but no words to write it. this airline may hv good quality planes but they feel at everything else and are thieves as well. won't give refunds when you are due one."
239,"Very bad customer service in Dubai airport during transit. Emirates staff charged me £70 just for my laptop bag in Dubai airport check in service as I went out to see Dubai Expo, but in London airport and Dhaka airport they allowed me to take my laptop bag plus cabin bag without any charge."
240,NO VEGAN OPTION FOR TRAVELLERS. Which means we won’t be travelling again with Emirates.It wasn’t all bad. Service from staff is good.Staff on check in desk super helpful in Dubai. They will go out of their way. They helped change meal plan to vegetarian but no vegan option.BROKEN LUGGAGE CASE on transit from UK although they gave us some money to cover the damage cost.
241,"Five stars....Having flown with Emirates many times I know how great they are, yet this is a review for when I never got to fly because of Covid.....They were amazing and have had all my fare money refunded....can not rate them highly enough"
242,Such an horrible experience because of the system (logiciel) and your staff were as helpless as me bcz check-in wouldnt go through. Been an hour waiting at the check-in point. How much I wish if I could cancel my meetings or used an option to travel via Paris... never again
243,"I have used exclusively to travel internationally with for 20 years (when the choice is mine). Reliable and familiar service on ground, and in the air.  I always book directly with them over the phone or on the web. On occasions they have price matched/refunded the difference when I have seen a cheaper booking elsewhere.  I have found them very helpful when I have had enquiries or issues before I travel."
244,"The airline is not as efficient as it used to be, at heathrow airport check-in the staff was very rude and not helpful at all. Even the cabin crew was very tired, careless and did not help with anything."
245,I fly with empires 4-5 times a year Uk to dubai business class. I am currently on the plane. It took two hours from boarding to be offered any refreshments  the bar is closed and no snacks and their excuse was just we don’t have these services today….no explanation. The worst emirates flight I’ve ever had. Pick up your standards and become the Emirates you used to be. It used to feel luxury now there’s no difference from virgin or BA
246,Manchester airport: worst customer service of all time.The woman at the counter didn't return my passport. I walked off without it and returned within 20 minutes. It had already been taken to lost property and I had to pay £25 to get it back. Will not be using Emirates going forward.
247,"Emirates is still one of the best Airlines to travel with! They even upgraded me to firsth Class from DXB-GRU! Service was fantastic and I’ll be definetly flying Emirates again!The cabin crews on all four flights have been absolutely fantastic, sadly on my return flights the Bars where closed on GRU-DXB & DXB-MAN flights, but this was due to COVID and trying to reduce risks for passengers therefore i understand it.The First Class Suites from DXB-GRU are amazing and the Service is outstanding, sadly i probably will not experience this again since the prices are very high. It is pure luxury to be able to have a shower on a 15hr flight and this i think was the most amazing part of the flight. It is really sad that Airbus stopped production of the A380 it is such a fantastic plane."
248,Customer service totally absent. I have spent all the evening on today and yesterday trying to inform about my mum disability and weelchair with no luck. After queening nearly an hour they are push me back to other ‘collegue’ with no luck. They don’t have any chat or other system to communicate. Hope tomorrow my mum will not be denied boarding. Never again
249,"We bought business ticket and trust me we are definitely not going to travel by emirates airlines again. uncomfortable small chair for business side with no space around.The food was so bad! I can’t imagine what they serve for economic class! The staff were friendly but they didn’t actually care. It was a person that were sitting beside us he was sick, was coughing really bad and the staff didn’t care at all when we talked to them about that. They told us that we ( Me and my husband) can seat separately if we are not comfortable with that. Unbelievable i was pregnant and had my 2 years old daughter was forced to seat alone with my daughter without my husbands help because we didn’t want to get sick during this Pandemic. We have traveled by business with other airlines before and this experience was not even close to our others before. We just waste our money and payed x 10 times more comparing with economy class. So please please believe me don’t book business class with  Emirates airline because they just invest to their first class part."
250,"The whole holiday was excellent from the booking process to the accommodation. The only negative was the flight. From Manchester UK.—- Dubai the service onboard was poor standard. My wife ordered a bland meal. She was given her meal, before the main meal delivery. I received my meal 50 mins later during the standard meal service from the meal cart. My wife was then offered a drink with her meal unfortunately she had finished her meal over an 40 mins before getting the wine with her meal. The quality of the meal was poor. The cabin crew looked very busy and very little time to deal with issues and requests. Only one drink service offered during the flight, no offer of water or soft drinks between service, no menu offered, so we did not know what the bar service had to offer. The flight back was much better, we were seated on the upper deck it was half full. We managed to move seats which gave us more space to stretch out. We still had the issue with the meal delivery my wife given her meal first I was served I had to wait until the main meal delivery, waited 40 mins again  by that time my wife had finished her meal still waiting for her drink with her meal.we were seated in a cabin area with two other guests. The ground handling in Manchester and Dubai was excellent and the new Covid checks were well managed by all the staff."
251,"Good Airline, flew 4 times , no complain"
252,"I have tried to contact Emirates directly but they make it incredibly difficult on their website to get through to them..   Ticket number GFN2YB Flight Dubai to Heathrow 21st December.  I booked this for my son to fly home for Xmas.  2 days prior to the flight, his PCR came back saying he was positive.  I wanted to delay the trip, but I could only cancel it.  Trip cost £450, and I was offered only £109 refund as that was the only option, besides him being a  No Show.   This is daylight robbery.   I would still like my son to fly out as he is now covid free.  Why should I be penalised £350????  I booked via Trip.com booking reference 16752930833.   I have had numerous conversations with them and this is an Emirates cancellation policy, not theirs.   Would somebody please sort this out urgently for me,"
253,"The worst airline ever used.  Took us 2 hrs to get our luggages at Dubai and also another 2 hrs at JFK airport They ran out for food, serving Indians food both way. For the money we paid for each ticket, could get business class for other airlines . Save your money, and energy One star is a lot for this review"
254,Very poor standard of service by ground check in staff. Completely ignorant about the UK government exemptions listed on the PLF forms. Wasted an hour of my time because they did not know about the exemp status of jobs and kept trying to contact people in London to talk to them. Made me redo the PLF forms to the only way they knew which is not what was supposed to be reflected on the forms. Its a joke. I would avoid Emirates until they fix their check in process
255,EWF66F - absolutely shocking customer service. I spent over 8 hours trying to get through to them on phonelines in the UAE and ended up having to call the UK number just to get through to someone. Was then refused to speak to management and they left me stranded in Abu Dhabi with no assistance and no rebooking.
256,I cannot begin to explain the dreadful experience I am in the middle of with Emirates.  They have taken thousands of dollars from me for no reason other than their terrible customer service.  I have not been able to reach them for two weeks and when I spoke to an untrained person it cost me unknowingly 5000 dollars.  Never fly Emirates.
257,"I purchased a watch on ek001 and by the time I'd collected my luggage it had fell off my wrist and is lost I called emirates who told me to call another department,  who told me they can't help More than disappointed I purchased a su  standard product and applied that noone even took my details incase its handed inI've been flying from Brisbane to UK with emirates for 13 years and now, I think it's time to move to an airline that understands and practices customer service that reflects the prices charged"
258,Unacceptable from such a big airline.  Not sure if it’s because of Covid or if they have always been this way.  Little to none customer service experience.. forget about getting through to an agent.  The business class isn’t all that either.
259,"I've flown Manchester to Dubai on several occasions and can only mention how friendly and hard working their staff are. The cabin is always clean and tidy. In-flight entertainment is great. Food very good for an aircraft meal. I have never had to complain over the phone to Emirates, so all the reviews about this, I cannot comment on this. The flight experience is great though."
260,"I'm writing this as a warning to others.. I don't want ANYONE to go through what I have.My family are due to travel to Mauritius on Friday, it'll likely be the last holiday my Dad has, he's 90 with mid stage Alzhiemers. Whilst sorting stuff out yesterday it became apparent one of my party had their name wrong on the ticket. I have spent hours on the phone trying to sort it. Basically one of the party has a hyphened name, Heidi-Louise, not Heidi Louise. Today I've been told it will cost me just under £1200 to get it changed. I haven't stopped crying since. I have no choice but to pay, the money I'm using though was put aside for my Father's funeral.  I cannot believe Emirates could be so cruel. This holiday cost £30.000... I'd never fly with them again. So be aware. Check and check again, even the obvious could be wrong."
261,"Flew from Singapore on Saturday night. Flight delayed for 3 hours. Managed to get my connection to Manchester. When I arrived no suitcase. I am on holiday and need my suitcase. Rang Emirates, no response - line too busy. They say that suitcases that arrive late will be delivered within four hours. It is now 13 hours since the case was delivered. No sign of case. This is ruining my holiday. I will never use this unprofessional outfit agin."
262,"Emirates i one of the best Flight i ever Experience. Their staff is so co operative, with  Luxurious protocols in even economy classes. They provide their whole Strength to comfort us and make ys Happy. Thanks Emirates 🥰 they are so punctual as well"
263,"Worst customer service ever. Due to an error in the airport, my wife was refused to be boarded to the flight. No help from the check-in, no proper information, or direction, or there was any personnel to help her. No help desk either. She was told to call customer services. She stayed on line for 3 hours, 3 HOURS!!!! no one picked up. Missed her flight, and no one returned to our complaint either."
264,"When you need assistance, it's impossible to get through. I was quite dissatisfied with the phone wait times. I've been waiting for about three hours with no indication that anyone is picking up the phone. It's unbelievable!"
265,"Do not fly Emirates. If you have to deal with the customer services department, you will be frustrated beyond belief  and will have to pay extortionate charges."
266,Very bad experience the manger of Emarites airlines in Cairo airport is very aggressive and treats Passenger with disrespect
267,"My wife and I were due to board the 9.40 am flight EK029 from Dubai to Heathrow London on 28th Dec 2021. We were only informed about the Passenger locator form when we were due to board the flight. Despite checking in online, at the airport luggage drop section we were not asked or told about this form until we were about to board. Consequently having to complete the form meant we missed our 9.40am flight. We were told to now pay £650 for economy seats on the 2.30 pm flight to Heathrow, despiter already having booked return flight. We waited 4 hours in a queue to get re-issued return tickets and our boarding passes. We asked for help to be served but we were told that the staff that was supposed to be serving us had all taken two hours lunch at the same time. When we arrived at Heathrow after 6 pm, our luggage was missing. On inquiry, we were told that it is still in Dubai despite the fact Emirates had four hours to load our luggage onto the 2.30 pm flight. We are now told that once the luggage arrives at Heathrow the next day, Monday we will have our luggage delivered to our home address. The luggage only arrived Wednesday afternoon. The experience and treatment we have had on this return flight is unacceptable and no one wants to take responsibility. No Customer Relations can be contacted by phone or spoken to, no complaints process or transparency to give customers assurance of the procedure and timescale to resolve any complaint. Each customer service staff tells me they cannot help me."
268,"they never answer the phone, always very busy. don't rely on customer service. iam trying to get in touch without succes."
269,"Horrendous foods were served , and after some people complained they came back with bunch  of apples and biscuits  that even were not enough to feed those angry costumers,"
270,"I always had a good experience with Emirates, but recently there seem to have change 180 degrees.(1) A few days befoee my deparring flight from Tokyo (EK319) , I get Emirates email that my flight has changed. BUT the Dubai transit time for the new itinerary has increased from 2 hours to TWENTY HOURS TRANSIT TIME. (2)I tried to contact Emirates from Tokyo, the only option was to call their Dubai phone number ( Emirates email, live chat or local office options were not available/responsive) . I wasted FOUR hours of my time and my entire Skype call credit, behind the Emirates customer support service line, but after entering my flight info, it got into an endless loop of ""thanks for waiting"", FOUR HOURS behind line, calling at different times and no answer.(3) Finally I had no choice and went to Narita airport. I told them about the changed flight which has 20 hours transit time in Dubai airport. They said they cannot provide any accommodation in the airport so after the 12 hour flight from Tokyo to Dubai, I would have to stay in the airport for another 20 hours, 32 hours in total. Seems like the Emirates representative forgot that I am a human! (3) The Emirates representative at the Narita airport was rather rude, avoiding any explanation and insisting that there is nothing that can be done. His mantra was  ""It is not possible sir"". Finally the only thing I got, after lots of shout and frustration, was a changed flight  for another day, so I had to return the whole way - 3 hours - from Narita Airport. The changed itinerary had 9 hours delay, which was still much longer than my original 2 hour transit time (In similar situations in the past, Emirates used to offer free accommodation for affected passengers that had transit time of more than 8 hours - apparently those customer service days are gone).(4) Now, before the date of my return flight, another surprise happens. I get email from Emirates about a change e in my Itinerary. When I check, it shows that the rescheduled flight to Dubai lands 4 hours AFTER my connecring flight to Tokyo!!! I am trying to reach customer service to sort this one out, so far without successs."
271,"My wife and I paid AED 3000 for excess baggage. One of our bags did not make it with us containing essential clothes and equipment for our house. The bag, despite being told it would be delivered on the next flight, still has not arrived three days later. Emirates has not answered hours of waiting for customer service, not responded to emails, nor followed up on any level. I can safely say we will never fly with them again, nor would I recommend them"
272,One of the best airlines to travel with in these covid times. They regularly fly into NZ and are reliable.Will use again.
273,"We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without informing us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they have a close partnership and are owned by the same people. Secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future."
274,"The worst customer service in the world. Whichever method you try they are uncontactable. There is always a function on their website that DOES NOT work making it impossible to submit your complaint/query. I had several issues to address but there was no one available to redress my concerns. Communication is non-existent; you are communicating with a brick wall! I joined your skywards program before I flew, however they did not credit me with my air miles. I would have thought they’d have been credited automatically at check-in but I wasn’t asked. Check in was a bad experience- the counter assistant didn’t know the COE had been replaced by the Thailand pass and that caused me a lot of stress. I transited in Dubai making a connecting flight to Thailand. At the boarding I was once again asked for all my papers (hotel test and go package, insurance, Thailand pass etc) despite already having a boarding pass. Surely their Dubai personnel should have known a boarding pass would not have been issued in the first place without the relevant documentation. Your conduct was totally unnecessary and lacked professionalism. The entire staff are in need of training to keep up with current criteria. Their website is ultra-user-unfriendly and very buggy.  There always seems to be at least one function that doesn’t work, which makes it impossible to submit. All in all flying Emirates was a horrid experience for me.  I was disappointed because of the aforementioned issues. I’d advise anyone thinking of flying Emirates to choose an alternate airline."
275,"The best way to describe my issues is by cut and pasting the email sent to the CEO on the basis that customer services do not exist . Dear Mr Clark Let me start off my saying that your ground staff at Heathrow are absolutely amazing and have gone above and beyond the job description. The staff on the flight also amazing and the service impecable. My complaint is realistic and in over 30 years of flying I have never been treated so appaling by your so called help desk and reservation staff, which I believe is outsourced in Manchester, in order to make sure that I have highlighted the failures the issues are listed below. 1: both your staff at Heathrow and myself held on the phone line for over 50 minutes with no response, this was even after presing the option for business class. 2: when another passenger finally got through to them and passed the phone around so that my issue could be solved, the operative spent 15 minutes arguing with me and telling me how he could do nothing. 3: after an intervention by your ground staff he finally said he would resolve the issue, he then went back to the original we cannot do anything . 4: when ground staff intervened again he changed his tone and instead of dealing with iseue went on to say it was a promotional fare and could only re book economy at a cost of £200 .. strangely no mention of the upgrade to business which I had paid for . 5: finally at the end after the flight being held open for an extra ten minutes .. he gave up and said he didn’t have enough time to change the flight . The saga started at 20.15 and ended with your reservations not being able to anything nearly 2 hours later. The iseue here is that in an emergency or we in my case when i was held up due to a traffic issue and could not get to the airport on time passengers have little or no option to change to another flight, the online booking system cannot help and from my and other passengers experience your reservations are of little or no use whatsoever. I am of course mystified as to how an airline that provides an amazing in flight service and an amazing ground staff can allow itself to fall down on the fundamentals of providing a service to its clients, business class passengers and first class are the ones who provide the cream on the cake for airlines, the difference between large profits and small, yet I was made to feel and was talked to like a leper by your reservations team, we can of course use the stock answer for 2021 that the pandemic had caused issues, however that is now wearing thin to say the least. My intention here is to bring this iseue to your attention as every CEO knows the buck stops with them, my customer experience was shall we say stressful, I have no idea what your ground crew did but they called me back to the airport as I was about to leave ( whislt still holding to speak to your reservations hotline ! To get onto the 0900 ) and rushed me through the process carried my bag onto the airline to make sure it was on board and got me to the plane at 21:45 , the effort the showed should be rewarded in some way. As I am about to finally land in DXB my experience with Emirates .. is sadly tainted, however the on board staff and ground crew at Heathrow will make me fly again with emirates. I do hope that you have the time to reply to this email as it shows a major flaw in the service emirates provides.  And then to add insult to injury I got this when I had already arrived in UAE message:From: EmiratesDate: 26 November 2021 at 12:57:03 GMT+4To:Subject: The departure time has changed for your flight to Dubai﻿ Add Emirates to your safe senders list	 EmiratesThe departure time has changed for your flight EK0008 to DubaiEmirates Booking Reference: BUGQHBDear customer,The departure time of your flight has been changed as follows:Flight Number	Origin	Destination	New Departure TimeEK0008	London (LHR)	Dubai (DXB)	10:10 Friday 26 NovWe’re sorry for any inconvenience caused.

276,"Having never flown with Emirates before my expectations were quite high considering you boast about your award winning services and regard yourselves as one of the top airlines.The first downfall was at Heathrow airport, when our flight (EK030 @ 15:50) was delayed due to technical issues. Now I know these things happen so I wasn’t too annoyed at the time, my only concern was relating to my connecting flight in Dubai. My first step was to call your customer services help line where I was greeted by a rude member of your team who was no help at all. He wasn’t the slightest bit interested in my concern and just suggested that I should find the airline desks located somewhere within Heathrow departures. I made my way down to the airline desks to look for an Emirates representative to speak to however to my surprise there was no one to be found (quite poor taking into account that you had just delayed a flight for a considerable amount of time). Thankfully a lady from British Airways - clearly an airline that had their act together, was there to assist. She suggested that if we went to the Emirates lounge we may find someone who can help. Arriving at the Emirates lounge we were informed that if we missed our connecting flight it would be rearranged for us, but we would have to speak to someone in Dubai. So off we were sent to wait, still none the wiser of what was going on. We were then called to our gate and made to queue for 30 minutes so that our previous boarding card could be confiscated and we could be issued with new ones for the later flight (@ 7:30) which was almost 4 hours after our original. Bearing in mind we had already sat in the airport for 3 hours so we would now have to wait 7 hours before even getting on a plane. Settling into the flight I was relieved that we were finally on our way. We had paid to select our seats for the flights however because we weren’t on our original this did not apply £280 down the drain - which I assumed Emirates would refund me but there has been no mention of this. We had been shoved at the back of the plane by the crew seats who were making noise and swapping seats every 10 minutes to take it in turns eating dinner. There wasn’t one member of staff on that flight who was polite to us, at one point I asked to buy a bottle of water and I was told I couldn’t, but they would get me a cup of water instead. 30 minutes later, after having to ask 3 more times they brought over my cup of water that was barely a mouthful shortly followed by what they described as food - it was terrible.After arriving in Dubai we went straight to the Emirates desks. We were told by another unhelpful and rude member of your staff to wait in a queue, so we did. 40 minutes later we reach the front of the queue and explain what has happened for them to tell us to go to a different desk and (surprise) queue again. This time it took us well over an hour to reach the front of the queue as people were pushing to the front. However the Emirates staff told us that they were allowed to push in because they were “business class” customers leaving me feeling rather angry.  The lady issued us with new boarding cards again in two random seats on the plane. We had to argue this to get our seats next to each other - still not the double seats we had paid for but better than nothing. When we finally reached Malé matters only got worse. Due to a result of your delays we were too late for our hotel transfer that had been organised for us. We had to travel to a different hotel to spend the night, which was no where near as expensive or as good as the one we had booked & paid for. The following morning we had to wake up early to travel back to the airport to then catch the transfer to the hotel we had booked. All in all Emirates had cost us 30 hours of our lives that we will never get back, all the hassle and stress that went along with it, a full day of our rather expensive holiday whilst also being rude, unhelpful and quite frankly unprofessional. I’m dreading our return flight home in a couple of days. One things for sure, I will never be using this airline again."
277,Unclear and inconsistent guidelines from staff regarding  current travel requirements. Not sure staff were well informed on passenger vaccine proof. Manager was very abrupt and took far too long to resolve the situation.
278,Impossible to get through when you need help. Really disgusted in the call wait times. I’ve been waiting nearly 3 hours with no indication of anybody answering the call. Absolutely shocking!
279,Help me resolve a problem that was not even theirs. It was the travel agency's problem. Thank you so much
280,Great options to choose as connecting flights . Safe and clean . Food is average. Some staffs are professional and some are not . Some ground handling staffs do not have smiles at all .
281,"Pathetic customer service. You receive a promotional email from Emirates to apply for Master credit card and take benefits for first purchase with some discounts. In order to get the discount, you have to receive an email with unique discount which I have not received even after my application approved. Customer service said I have to contact bank and bank said automated email did not generated and they have opened a case to investigate the issue and it would take upto 30 days to resolve. I was like WTH! As the promotion came from Emirates, I reached back to Emirates and the customer service was horrible and I am frustrated to the core. I spent lot of hours with customer service with zero input. For no reason, they made open a credit account and they should have take some level of responsibility when you promoting something. Very bad"
282,"Horrible airline! On a 14 hr. flight from Austin, Tx to Dubai most people didn’t wear a mask. Airline didn’t enforce mask wearing even when pointing it out. Very unsafe airline! Would not recommend this to any health concious individuals."
283,"I'm writing this as I'm 47,000 feet in the air on my flight from London to dubai.I'm in economy the staff are fantastic brilliant service best flight I've ever been on.2 dinners so many free drinks staff trying their best to please 5*"
284,"After an unfortunate situation of a ticket being erased because the passenger didn't catch the flight to Dubai, his ticket back to Portugal was unexistant causing the passenger to lose the flight back to Portugal.After calling the support, another ticket was offered for the next possible available date!Good costumer support!"
285,"Worst Customer Service Booked two first class tickets, need to make a small change and have been unable to speak to any representative for days! Left on hold for hours on end! Total waste of time"
286,"Please do not book anything with this airline - absolutely shocking customer care. Website is useless, links don't work, emails not responded to, calls just ring out. A disgrace and, judging by other comments on this site, a common problem."
287,"I contacted Emirates Manchester a few days before a flight to Dubai My 72yo wife has a lung weakness and cannot walk quickly but normally can manage short distances. She twisted her knee badly and I knew she would be in a lot of pain  so requested support from Emirates to assist in Dubai with a buggy or wheelchair to reach immigration. The unhelpful staff explained that rules prevented the chair as we had booked and paid for seats in economy on the upper deck of the flight? If we cancelled these seats and returned to the lower deck,apparently, we could have a wheelchair. The logic was not clear. My wife could walk up a few steps but not the distance to immigration. She made it with a few stops along the route but with a lot of pain. Emirates are a most unsympathetic airline who care care not one jot about the passengers they are responsible for. They will not see my business again"
288,Appalling customer service and complete lack of professionalism at the check in desks. The staff have no knowledge of the travel requirements of the different countries you are travelling to resorting in requesting unnecessary and expensive PCR tests even when not required despite being shown evidence to the contrary. Still won’t admit they were wrong so will be seeking legal advice and complaining to the CAA. Don’t book this airline if you don’t need a PCR test as they will insist you have one anyway.
289,"By far the worst air travel and customer service experience. I booked 2 tickets directly with Emirates a month before the travel. Few days before the travel they send me an email of date changes they made on their own to our flight dates. We tried endlessly to contact the customer service via email, Online chat, Phone but there was no one anywhere to talk. Due to medical reasons we needed to make changes to one ticket for which they were unreachable. If I tried to do it online myself, it would not let me make any changes to one ticket. So there is no human factor with this airline. Please be careful before you book tickets with this airlines, it is all about their business and money. There is no consideration of passengers health and safety concerns, no respect to the doctors letter also.Extremely disappointing experience. Please avoid Emirates."
290,"Worst airline very bad customer service, never book this airline. They are scamming your money with the help of travel company"
291,I have booked a flight with Emirates for late November and have been trying to contact them to book a wheelchair for my aunt. As so many of you have said there is absolutely no way to contact them. Phones don't get answered and emails don't get a response. A recorded voice keeps on directing you to their website to manage the booking but there is no way you can book a wheelchair online. When the travel agent tried even their request was rejected. NEVER book with Emirates if you require assistance.
292,Unable to reach the customer service. Been hours waiting on the phone but no luck. Tried again and again to get a auto response and end the call automatically. WORST WORST EXPERIENCE - Online Change Booking is a rip off.
293,"My perfect airline. I fist search on their website before booking by any airlines. In less than a year I reached the Gold Status and upgraded for free to business class in various occasions. The service and the food are exceptional. I liked the Emirates lounge in Dubai a lot. I can even take a shower during my stay at the lounge. I liked also the A380, no 1 for me."
294,Gold Diggers in covid times!! I had soft copy of my vaccine documents but they would not let me board the flight in Dubai insisting I carry a hard copy. They charged me usd5 for a single print out and insisted on cash payment only!! Rude staff with arrogant attitude. Never flying on this airline again!!
295,"Useless customer service never book a flight with them, I got an email letting me know my flight got cancelled and they asked me to call. I had to wait for 3 long hours to get to them only to hear they cannot do anything, they are cancelling flights to sell it for a higher price."
296,"Impossible to reach emirates customer service !!For the last 3 days, I have called 10 times, each time waited for over an hour before they just say they can't take my call at the moment, please try again later.terrible !!! Should be able to give 0 stars."
297,"Absolute disgrace. First time flying with Emirates and NEVER AGAIN. Booked ticket for 2 adults and 1 infant. System bugged, didn't get a booking confirmation, can only see 1 ticket in manage booking section online even though I got charged for 3. Emailed with complaint, no response, most of the time the phones lines are cut off, and they're up you spend hours waiting on hold. Still waiting for a solution and again been put on hiold for the past 1h and 20 minutes."
298,"I am so disappointed with Emirate Airlines and their customer service.  We are heading to India for our son's wedding.  They have changed flight times which is fine as these are difficult times but trying to contact them is impossible.  We have also lost flight costs for flights 2 years ago but now we have paid for Business class for the 5 of us - impossible to book hotel (service for business class) or rebook for my son's cancelled flight.  If I thought I could trust them to reimburse I would cancel all of flights and rebook with Qatar.  However, we are only 1 month away from the wedding."
299,"Emirates made more flights available to India, and now cancelled most of them, putting us on a waitlist not telling us what is our queue number on the list. Spoke to duty manager Criselle, Sayeda as business class is available to upgrade us on that as they cancelled our tickets and not us. No help whatsoever, advised to speak to Contact centre Manager Rasha Sami, no joy there too..bunch of crooks and money robbers. Seen so many reviews to other passengers with the same experience."
300,"Absolute joke!! Been trying to get through to change a booking from a Covid cancelled flight. Each time I wait forever. Then, when I do eventually get through, the line is cut off. Clearly a deliberate attempt avoid honouring their tickets. We had to do the same with our Finnair flights and everything was extremely on their website. In comparison, this airline is an absolute disgrace"
301,"Disgrace and Pathetic Customer Services.They cancelled my flight on their own behalf and now I am calling them from one week and on call with them from more than 2 hours. My call is still on hold and no one responds. Not a lot of time is left in my holidays and trying to rebook my flight. No response. Then I called my friend to call from Dubai, same again. Phone was on hold for 40 mins but no response. Please go for British Airlines. They are way better in customer services. No way to be in contact with Emirates."
302,"For the last 3 days I have called 7 times, each time waited for over an hour before they just say they can't take my call at the moment, please try again later. Should be able to give 0 stars."
303,"What happened to you Emirates? You used to be a leading airline but not anymore.  I have wasted god knows how many phone calls and waiting over hours just to get through only to get a name change done on a ticket but it's just impossible.  First time I speak to someone and they say it can be done and then the call drops while there is still full signal on my end, no one calls back. 2nd time I speak to someone who says they will try to do it and contact me in 2 - 3 hrs, nothing! Third time - well it's the same scenario as the first time. It seems like the calls are being dropped on purpose with no intention of Emirates to serve their customers? SORT IT OUT!"
304,"Getting in touch with customer service is simply not possible, in spite of calling at different times of the day, waiting for more than 30 min each time."
305,"I need to cancel my flight, but I didn't receive the confirmation email and didn't know my reservation code.I wasted 3 phone calls only to wait 30+ minutes in total without reaching an operator.By chance, a reminder email contained the reservation code, so I request to cancel through their form. It's been more than a week and no reply has arrived yet.The flight date is near, so I'm trying to change the date, at least, to take time. But there are no options for the same price (it should be free of charge)."
306,"Horrible experience with Emirates even though I am a silver member. They have changed a confirmed booking twice - including dates/ wait time for onward journey/ etc. They assume they can simply do anything with your booking because you are at their mercy. When you call, guess what, call center simply rejects your call saying they can't take your call. Not for a little while, but days together. Now I worry that by the time I get through to Emirates call center, it will be too close to my travel date and nothing can be changed anyway.Want to complain to management? Good idea, you can't even find the CEO's name or email. THere is a Tim Clark who is CEO of USA but his email bounces. NOne of the other executive contacts listed have working emails!All this for spending close to $3000 for an economy ticket!"
307,"Yet another 2hr 45 min wait to speak to someone in an multinational organisation and not even an apology and when you get through, you are made to feel completely insignificant and they just try to fob you off! Tried to be put through to a manager and put back on hold and the original girl buggered off! Absolute disgrace.Good luck to any one who tries to call them! As always, if you call the sales line you get straight through! Funny that as no focus on customer care and just on sales!Emirates management - why don't you call your various departments to get to see the customer journey for yourself!"
308,Want to hear a joke? I was tossed around between Emirates and travel agency as none would agree to change my flight tickets so eventually Emirates customer service lady very smartly and seriously suggested me to organise a conference call between Emirates and lastminute.com customer service helplines so that Emirates tells off lastminute.com they are not doing their job and have policies to follow :) does anyone have tips how to best do that?
309,Emirates has cancelled my flight and there is no option online to make a change to this booking to a different date.Have called the customer service three times holding for more than 40 minutes each time and haven’t gotten through an agent yet. Not sure what I can do now
310,"It is difficult writing a review for most airlines at the moment, because they are generally terrible. I have flown Lufthansa (by far the worst), Qatar (almost equally bad), British Airways (so far the best of the main airlines), and Emirates. They all get a one star for customer service lines: BA is a little better because at least they give terrible service politely. Emirates has really long waiting times, but at least most problems can be solved."
311,"Has faced the worst experience in decades, on 25th October on flight EK 613, we were flying to London from Islamabad and were refused to onbaord by Emirates staff for not having passenger locator form. We are British Citizens, fully vaccinated, had negative PCR test reports and Covid-19 passes issued by the UK health authorities. Missed this form because my son was in hospital few hours before the flight on account of high fever and chronic cough. On 25th at airport we waited in the queue for check in for about two hours. While waiting one of the female members of the Emirates staff inspected the documents and said we are good to go. She didn't mention about passenger locater form at all. Same female staff member later took the picture of our passports and provided no explanation why she took the pictures. Entire Emirates team was extremely rude and unhelpful. That's why this has raised serious questions how Emirates Airline handles our personal information. Finally we reached at the check in desk after two hours and were told passenger locater form is missing. The check in officer, acted so arrogantly and become more intimidating when he read the Christian name of my son, and threw away our British Passports on the desk rather providing a piece of guidance, he challenged me I am incapable of filling out the forms. My wife was crying out her tears, my two years son who was unwell was distressed by the situation but unfortunately none of the Emirates staff members came forward to help us in this compelling family situation. They watched this drama for entire two hours but none of them even uttered a single word of compassion. This is a breach of basic human rights & family respect particularly when you have infant travelling with you. After this traumatic experience we drove almost 400 KM to Lahore Airport to take next flight to the UK and paid almost £1500, bought new Qatar Airways tickets to catch up our work commitments in the UK next day. I wish if Emirates staff in Islamabad could ever spare a moment to feel the pain which we have gone through.I am hoping to write to draw the British Foreign Secretary's attention to the inhuman attitude of Emirates staff in Islamabad who is employed to help us, answer our queries, find best solutions in problems not to come up with racist and discriminatory attitude to destroy the basics values of human respect, dignity and right. Qamar Rafiq"
312,"I booked a holiday to Dubai for the 4 of us in business class and traveled from manchester on the 11th October on the afternoon flight 2:20pm ish the staff on the flight our a credit to emirates and the Irish girl was amazing and really looked after us, I hope she reads this and keeps her glasses on.😎 she will know what that means, we come back on the 22nd October and the staff again was amazing I have flown on emirates at least 10 times and for me is the best airline, treat the staff with respect and not servants"
313,"What was supposed to be our first flight on Emirates is now our last! My wife and I met in Seychelles after being separated by the pandemic for roughly 2 years. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen afterwards. Emirates was our first departing flight with two connecting flight after. Upon check-in at the desk, the Emirates supervisor on duty prohibited me from boarding the plane. She said I couldn't board because as a USA citizen I needed an existing visa. We attempted to explain that Philippines Bureau of Immigration allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. The supervisor stated their system indicated that I had to have a visa and that these provisions were not listed. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan program had resumed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily with COVID restrictions/entry requirements. She added if I was allowed to board I'd likely be offloaded and deported in Dubai at our next flight. So, we agreed to follow up with the Philippines Bureau of Immigration. When asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Philippines Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry under the Balikbayan program. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. HOWEVER, we incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And other airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time a Mr Ayman Nasser continued to cordially reiterate that they took  ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add.""International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flighting Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. We had to extend our time in Seychelles for more than 3 weeks trying to resolve this matter. I have yet to receive refunds for other flights we had to cancel and travel insurance has indicated this is not likely to be covered. This was a huge financial hardship in our early marriage. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they (the call center, the airport staff, the city office) referred me to the online complaint system.  It was so useless I don't even know why they brothered to send me delayed replies. They didn't address any concern or ever explain why the airport supervisors could approve me to rebook and board but the online customer service could make say something completely different.I hope everyone separated by the pandemic makes better choices for airlines than Emirates. P.s. For anyone who questions the validity of my claims, I can provide you complete documentation of everything"
314,"Absolutely disgraceful , do not fly with these people, booked tickets 4 months prior, Emirates have cancelled the flight twice on me, trying to ring them back will not pick up phone. Now I have a flight going out but no flight coming back home, do not book with these people"
315,"I understand things happen and due to ""operational reasons"" flights can be cancelled.  This happened to me and I was not notified, no email or anything.  I then had to wait over an hour to get through to their customer services who after a while managed to resolve my issue minus the long stay at Dubai airport. (could have offered a hotel as a gesture)  Staff were like robots, no empathy or apology.  Standards have fallen.  Will be looking to use other airlines going forward.UPDATE: 04/11/21Return flights cancelled which means on alternative date connecting flight wait time is 17 hours.  Very poor service from Emirates"
316,"I fly to Dubai on average a couple of times a year and always choose Emirates Business Class, however their standards have really dropped following Covid and not only was the customer experience when checking in not good either in London or Dubai, my Emirates car didn't arrive to collect me in Dubai and I was forced to make my own way to the airport. I explained this at the time and they really couldn't care at all.  Such a shame because I used to really enjoy their service level and now it feels like a budget airline check in!"
317,cancelled flight last minute. offered overnight layover instead with no accomodation!! No other reasonable options offered.
318,"Worst customer service I have EVER received, with terrible crisis management and definitely racial profiling staff."
319,"Went to board a flight tonight (16th October 2021) from Manchester to Dubai. Got to the check in desk and was told by a Lauren Buckley she couldn’t let me on the flight as my passport had slight damage to it (a scratch which I wiped off). She then proceeded to infront of a airport full of people, my 3 month old daughter and myself start shouting at my partner telling him she won’t be apologising and she gets to decide who gets on her flight. Even though my face was clearly recognisable on the passport which she stated infront of everyone because there was a scratch she said it was damaged then when my boyfriend wiped it off she said we had tampered with a legal document. Everyone was shown the passport and couldn’t understand why she was refusing me to board. Slammed the passport on the side and told me to leave. When we spoke to our family who live in Dubai they couldn’t understand why she was doing is. We passed the phone over and not only was she rude to myself and my partner in front of our 3 month old and an airport full of people she was then rude on disrespectful on the phone to my partners mother. She said she was team leader and she gets the final say. We asked to speak to a manager and she said nobody was available and we were to listen to her. We then left the airport and she was rude and intimidating as we left. Lauren Buckley is not a person you want representing Emirates. What a shame as we’ve flown plenty of times most recently Christmas and always had a good experience up until now."
320,Booked a flight with emirates. Paid more for the tickets than other flights. Our connection time was 2 hour. They changed our connecting flight with 23 hours transit time without any explanation or compensation. We can also not cancel the flight and ask for refund. Now we had to pay more to get better connection. Absolutely terrible service. Will never book with them again .
321,What a great airline. I flew from London-Dubai in business. This is the best flight I’ve ever had. The service was outstanding. The seats are so comfortable and lie totally flat. The food is great. I didn’t want the flight to end
322,Disgusting and appalling customer service. They cancelled my fight due to 'COVID' reasons assured me that I could re-book anytime. When I contacted them to re-book told no economy seats available and would have to pay £800 for Business. They should honor their agreement and provide free upgrade. But they are just thieves exploiting people. Also they don't have a complaints section which speaks volumes. I know they have an online form but you try and get a response or even get it submitted due to it not conveniently accepting it due to typos.
323,"Can’t relate to all the bad reviews. Had to cancel our flights (very easily through online form) because of covid and received the refund like 6 days after. Phone Customer service is quite busy and you gotta wait for 1 hour to get through, but all the employees I’ve talked to were super nice and helpful! I think we all should be a lot more patient with airlines since they’ve had to face so many changes/restrictions due to Covid … Would always choose this airline again!"
324,"I would give this zero stars if I could. I just had a very distressing conversation with Emirates tonight when I called to discuss the allergy that we have with my little girl. Unhelpful doesn't even begin to describe it and you will not supply food without nuts or traces, will not ask passengers not to eat nuts on the flight or make an announcement and will continue to serve nuts on the flight. This isn't acceptable. My wife is so upset and I don't know what to do. If someone eats nuts next to us or touches things she then touches that could make her really unwell or worse. How is that acceptable to you?I am happy to bring her food on board. All I am asking is that you do not serve nuts on the plane and ask passengers to refrain from doing so. It's totally within your control and you refuse to do it.I guess I’ll just have to hope my little girl doesn’t have an anaphylactic reaction which causes her throat to shut. Thanks Emirates, a truly unbelievable set of events in this day and age…"
325,"Best airline still I have seen. I used it four times for my travel to Asia and Africa. One time my flight has been cancelled however, I got my full refund with 12-14 days."
326,"Doesn't deserved a one star, just a s*t company with s*i*ty staff. Incompetent people just want you to pay extra when not needed. Such an A**hole staff and include bloody manager. F**king disappointed with emirates"
327,Had a bad experience on flight home 007 .. quite traumatised.. made a complaint as a skyward member but cannot submit tried 6 times .. seems like they don’t want complaining…ek671203525
328,lost our tickets then upgraded us to first class at the price of economy!! love them
329,Unprofessional call center employee Refund is a big lie they don’t refound shttt
330,"They are too much proud of themselves. Their service is very bad on land and on air. The only thing is that they are showing of with young beautiful half naked girls apart from that nothing to help your journey’s relaxation. If you ask for a cup of water, you can hardly get one after a long waiting if you will have it.I don’t recommend at all."
331,We had to change our flight due to COVID and were treated wonderfully and politely by Tioia during the process.
332,"always doesn't fly on time, 30 to 40 minutes late and always put responsibilities on customers and don't allow them to fly when little bit late. Avoid this corrupted airlines."
333,"Promos offered by Emirates are fake. They simply refuse to provide me confirmed “free” ticket to famous Dubai entertainment show!!! Saying I’m not eligible while it is confirmed in my tickets! Absolutely awful experience.Do not expect to get service from Emirates even if you paid and got it confirmed.Do not trust their sweet offers, you will get nothing by the end of the day."
334,"I never recommend this flight company any more.This flight changed the time of my return ticket without my permit , although I had the email of our tickets and confirmation number.                       We explained to the UAE members at Ika Iran International Airport but they said we follow what we have in our system and your return time is one month later and your husband's return time is for today. This issue was weird that had happened for my tickets scheduled,we had bought our two tickets from kayak website in Sandigo, California at the same time, why it had changed like that?   Emirate said it was your agent’s fault (kayak), but I had my ticket confirmation number which were both probably issued by emirate .  They did not help me and their customer service was very poor and rude.  After three hours of stress and hopelessness a friend of mine in canada could finally call the UAE office in Sandigo and explained all the story.  They fixed the problem for me from there and I could pass the gate at the last few minutes.  That situation was very stressful for me and my husband , I was really suffering and crying and I could not believe how much the UAE customer service of IKA could ignore the customer's right and not show any correct reaction to solving the problems . IKA airport didn’t have WIFI and we didn’t have access to any call or internet. A janitor who saw me helpless, lended his phone to us for contacting and getting help.I want to make a lawsuit about Emirate flight for all negligence that they did .Apparently it is a normal incident for them but for passengers who may have a travel once in a while especially in this covid situation can’t be normal and they should help me and fix the ticket immediately right in Ika airport."
335,"If you use Emirates, you can stay without a ticket and without money. I had two tickets for this flight on 13 July. On 4 July, I was informed that Emirates had canceled the flight. I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded  188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service DID NOT suggest this option for me. I have screenshots of these text messages. I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me. I DON'T recommend using Emirates. Try to avoid this airline, because they can deceive you and say: ""we are so sorry...""My booking references numbers are: Q3U766, DSJ3J2"
336,"Unfriendly staff, not helpfull, bad communicating with customers, customer service is too slow responding some times no respond , ignoring to answer customers, they looking for any reason to cancil your flght and lose your money if they found the weight of luggage is heavy .Avoid this airline and be sure if u buy non refundable ticket they may cancil anytime for any reason and you lose your money , this happend to my family twice , the reason was they are late while was 1 hour and 45 minutes to fly."
337,Very nice customer service by the lady on the phone. She was very polite and patiently helped me with my issue. It was very helpful.
338,"Me and my wife were treated horribly at Hanoi airport by Emirates' staff. We already have been delayed by the arrogant immigration office, which just wanted us to pay bribes. After sorting that out we had to go to a new table where the lady did everything to make our travel harder. First she wanted us to put our biggest luggage on the scale which measured 26kg, and she said we have to pay extra for that, OR we can move some of our things around to get wight out. At this point all of our luggage were covered with a plastic seal, so we couldn't remove that by hand, around 8 staff just watched me trying to get everything unpacked with bare hands, with no luck. They didn't offer to help, they didn't offer scissors or anything. I felt humiliated. As we had only 1 hour until the flight, I had to accept the $65 fine. Please note that previously I have checked with Emirates via phone how the weights work, and they said that we have 2x23KGs per person, and one luggage can go upto 32kg, as long as together not more then 46KG. Please also note, that all of our other luggage were well under weight, one of them only 8KGs! I also previously purchased a 23KG additional luggage just in case we would go overweight. Nothing mattered, they still pushed me to say yes to the $65, they also threatened me that we might miss the flight! After this the lady said that we don't have a booked flight from Tanzania (destination) to elsewhere, so she cannot let us go. This was very very disgusting, as we ALREADY had a visa to Tanzania, travel plans to Mozambique and Zambia which are both ""visa on arrival"" countries, they do not do evisas or other. We already presented these plans to the Tanzanian immigration and with these plans they accepted us and gave us the visas. But no, this was not good enough for the lady. She said she needs a flight. I had one booked previously, which I showed her, she said she cannot see it in the system, so again, we cannot go. She said that we need either a return or an onward flight. I asked her ""so any flight is OK, just have to go out from Tanzania?"" she said ""yes"". So I booked the first flight I could to Rwanda with Kenya Airlines, costing me £327.71. Bare in mind, we did NOT have a visa either to Kenya (there is the connection) or Rwanda! So if immigration would see this, they wouldn't let us in because of the lack of visa to those countries! After I booked a ticket a manager arrived and told the lady in Vietnamese (they didn't want me to understand) that we are free to go, because what we have is enough! Meaning I purchased those tickets for nothing! During this whole process your staff acted very unprofessionally, making me very stressed, which gave me chest ache. I had an aortic valve replacement, this kind of treatment and stress is very bad for my heart! They also disregarded my serious latex allergy, kept touching me and our things with Latex gloves, eventho we repeatedly ask them not to do that, OR use the gloves I carry with myself which are Latex free. During this whole process we felt discriminated as my wife is Vietnamese and I am European and these people seemed jealous that we can leave Vietnam despite the lockdowns."
339,Hope to see you soon on my next vacation. Good service.
340,Emirates takes no responsibility regarding their tickets and no follow-up from their cooperators that was not business class. Emirates business class is by the way not like they promise. Fly with Qatar instead :-) I will follow this advise I got from other dissatisfied with Emirates.
341,The only reason I give this a one is because I can't give a zero.The reason they get one star is because of their association with Arsenal FC whose senior management team are absolutely disgusting.
342,Been waiting for one hour now to a recorded message. no mention of where I am in the queue. I'm trying to rebook a flight that was cancelled due to pandemic. Instead of having my credit on my Skywards account I have to phone the Birmingham tel number to rebook. Surely it's easier to have the credit provided electronically?
343,"I have purchased ticket on August 18th for September 1st 2021 TICKET from karachi to istanbul. I did two PCR test as tickets are two. PCR test total cost 12000 PKR for Hashmani Lab. On 31st August I received email that my flight timings changed from 12:15 to 12:35. I packed my thing. I went for boarding. In a long line, after i reached there just couple of hours before departure they said we couldnt find your ticket in the system. I said how it is possible they said go to next counter. On next counter woman said, your ticket canceled we have no info call the call center.I have called call center and I asked why my ticket canceled they said your flight timings changed from Karachi to DXB so you couldnt meet transit time to IST flight so we canceled. Without any prior info or thing they have canceledNow they are rescheduling my flight to 11th of september. I have to bear PCR test 12000 PKR again apart of that my job is in jeopardy if I wont be able to join by 2nd september. Everyday my salary will be deducted and it is also another issue. Now they say do another flight, I booked 14 days ago so booking again immediate flight is 4 times expensive than what is price which I cannot afford (no one would). Emirates says it cannot do anything and whatever losses i will suffer it is my fate. Best the can do is reschedule on 11th."
344,"Recently I travelled back to the UK from Mumbai by Emirate flights. During check-in, I was told that the laptop weight is included in the 7kg cabin baggage allowance. Nowhere in Emirates website this is explicitly mentioned that the laptop weight is included in cabin-baggage. It only says that 1 piece of cabin baggage is allowed. Finally, I have to return important documents, confectionaries and some work related files to my relative who was waiting outside the airport.Who is responsible for this mess? Is this rule with Emirates Airlines only or with other airlines also?"
345,"I am trying to contact anybody in the company communications department but cannot find any details, all calls leave you holding on at 7p a minute. They just don’t want you to contact them."
346,"I paid quite a heavy fare for business class to ensure a comfortable journey, which unfortunately, ended up in a mess, mental stress and extremely disturbing for me. I didn’t receive my baggage upon arrival at Belgrade Airport, though, i emphasised to emirates staff at Islamabad airport due to some prescribed medications for my health issues and important documents related to my business meetings for which i was travelling. In addition to that, the 2nd leg of my journey from dxb to Belgrade was through Emirates business alliance Fly Dubai, and to my complete disappointment, it doesn’t seem to be a business class at all, rather it was nothing better than a bus service. The seats were torn out, seats couldn’t be inclined the way these are supposed to do in business class. I missed my medications and faced serious problems, and also my business meeting went in vain as i was not in possession of the relevant documents. I am not highlighting issues related to clothes and other stuff as i managed them somehow by purchasing which i did not need to.This is an extremely disappointing service quality provided by Emirates, and i am definitely going to take it to every possible forum including legal, social and all othe avenues."
347,"Im really satisfied with them service everything was really brilliant 🤩 customers service , to the staff at the airport , cabin crew , pilot when landing you will not feel it So professional Very recommended and please try it 💕💕💕"
348,"Still one of the best airljnes around. We used them to fly from London to Dubai, had a stop-over and went to Seychelles. The flight from DBX to SEZ was a bit unpleasent, as the plane was fully packed with people."
349,PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM EMIRATES One of the worst experiences cancelled my ticket and never got a refund. I just lost my flight ticket and money $1400 and now I can’t see my mom I’m a college student living in California
350,Me and my family travels a lot with many airlines and never had a relaxing experience with any airlines besides Emirates. There was no turbulence and the check-in was very smooth and quick.
351,I recently booked roundtrip emirates ticket  and they cancelled by return ticket after i reached.  i managed to travel back through different airline and i had to travel 50+ hours to get back.  However emirates is horrible with refund. They charged me more for the onward journey and refunded less!!! nice way to making business!!!  DO NOT BOOK EMIRATES
352,"I had booked a return flight to Zambia via Dubai, with the company edreams, but Emirates cancelled the outbound flight from Manchester to Dubai, and the onward flights.  They gave options to change to another flight or keep the tickets to re-book in the future.  I was not sure about the status of the return flights, but edreams said the whole flight was effectively cancelled, and I could clain a refund if I preferred that. In view of the uncertainty with Covid I opted to cancel and edreams requested a refund for me. they said it could take 2 to 3 months to receive the refund, but to my amazement,  I got the full refund onto my credit card in 7 days  Well done Emirates."
353,"Really this is very disappointing from Emirates as I am using emirates since 2015 and was ok but last month they showed that really they are sacrificing everything.We booked as a family our annual leave to our home country on 1st July, and of course due to the demand they provided A380 aircraft where it was fully booked the boarding process took them long time leaving passengers in the middle of no where even families with small kids like our family we were suffering without any help from anyone of the airline. During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came (???!!! Emirates ????) to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. Adding more I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that “sorry the oven is broke” this was really shocking as a response from an attendant, they even don’t know the customer service basics. And you know why? 2 rows behind us another family who never served with kids food till before landing with 40 min. And the mother was very angry with Emirates.I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and imagine when the flight took off ??  Delayed more with 150 min. I lost all my next day work meetings and had to postpone everything due to their mistake. I was really angry and I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation. I still have 2 flights already booked with them and really this will be the last time I will think flying with such bad attitude and service. With the money we paid we could go in business class for another airline with transit. I wish y booked flights with them will be safe as I don’t trust Emirates anymore."
354,"The airline is nice and enjoyable, however the website is misleading and some of the customer service are awfulI purchased miles as it’s mislead on the website regarding the value of them, I’ve asked for a refund as points.com (the company they sell the points through) allows it through the reward providerStill no refund or resolution even though I have been in touch all day, and a so called “senior advisor” was extremely rude and cocky during the phonecall, really unprofessional I spent £280 on miles and somehow that only discounts about £90 on my flight. You do the math. Lost £190 to Emirates who refuse to do anything about it"
355,excellent airline will never use any other
356,"I have flown with Emirates a number of times. Admittedly, the quality of service has decreased and some customer service people can be uncaring, but my experience has been mostly been good. But more and more I hear of QATAR, So will give them a try next time."
357,"Just a word of thanks and congratulations to Emirates Airlines, Recently I had to cancel our flights to Dubai which was booked on Emirates Airlines, because the Australian Government has advised all Australians Not To Travel overseas, until next year. I rang Emirates Dubai, two weeks ago and unbelievably my FULL refund for both my wife and myself is now credited to my credit card, Well done Emirates, when we are able to travel again I will certainly book Emirates."
358,"We flew with Emirates to the Maldives in December 2020, we deliberately booked with them as they were one of very few airlines where the flight stood a good chance of taking off unlike Virgin and BA who were constantly cancelling flights even though the destinations had reopened and the UK was no longer in a lockdown. The flight was a Airbus A380 to Dubai and then a Boeing 777 from Dubai to the Maldives. On the A380 the flight was  pretty much empty so we had the option to upgrade to Business Class for around £500 or remain in Economy. As I’d never flown in business before I agreed to pay the upgrade but unfortunately they had no window seats available and I wasn’t keen on sitting in the middle so I gave it a miss. I’m glad I saved myself the £500 as economy was mostly empty so I spread out and used the row of 3 seats as a lay flat bed instead.The food on all flights was amazing, I ordered vegan on some flights and Indian vegetarian on others as I eat eggs and dairy. The vegan dishes were okay prepared with so much effort, they even provide vegan cheese for the crackers!! In regards to Covid I felt safe at all times but at the same time I didn’t feel like they were going over the top. The cabin crew were amazing and on the flights to and from the Maldives I witnessed the crew being spoken to terribly and at times it appeared quite threatening and yet the crew remained calm and were able to defuse the situation quickly with the unruly passengers. I’d recommend booking with Emirates as they’ve continued to offer a full meal service which also included meals for special diets. BA on the other hand as well as a few others expect people with special diets to bring a packed lunch. Thanks Emirates for keeping us flying and making it possible to continue exploring the World in these difficult times."
359,"I was travelling on Emirates from Newark, USA to Quetta, Pakistan. My connecting flight from Dubai to Quetta was cancelled, when I was in mid air from Newark, USA to Pakistan. They offered me next flight to a different city in Pakistan (Karachi) with more than 20 hours waiting time in Dubai. Emirates refused any hotel stay in Dubai or Karachi to me. They refused me flight from Karachi to my original destination Quetta. Counter lady was rude while supervisor was diplomatic without offering solution. Finally I paid AED 2530 to book a flight on PIA (Pakistan International Airline) from Dubai to Islamabad and then Quetta. I might be wrong, but they do this to the South Asian countries passengers."
360,What happened?I was booked business class round trip from Saudi to Iceland transiting through Dubai and then Frankfurt. I received an email 13 days prior to departure changing my flight time and layover duration up to 9 ours instead of 50 minutes in Dubai. I will not go through the return flight which is a worst story.The problem!is that my flight from Frankfurt to Iceland didn’t changed and I will miss it by 5 hours after it departs!!!! Flight booked by Emirates for me on Icelandic airlines What I did?I called customer care and they gave me worst options. They offered me to cancel my flight and keep it for future plans or have a refund.  I went through their website and canceled my flight and requested full refund. The call center told me that I will be refunded the whole amount paid without charged any fees.***I hope they stick to it because I will go bananas on them if they don’t.Post experience:—Bad experience and last time flying with them during Covid.— I am frequent flyer with Emirates with silver skyward tag.Update:Jan 22I was fully refunded after 3 weeks of cancellation.
361,"Had to travel from Denmark to Bagdad (Iraq) with a 12 hours transit in Dubai. No food vouchers, no help for sleeping rooms or any sleep spaces available in the airport. We are 5 people inclusive a child who has been awake for almost 24 hours now. I will never fly with Emirates or to Dubai again."
362,Why is it always very hard to get in touch with support ?
363,"Unprofessional customer service .Lost my bag and never got help at all to find it.They were stuck on one request to get receipts for what is inside which was not possible!!!I have got news about its place on Cairo airport and told them about it and kept waiting to receive my bag which has never shown up!!!Now i am going back to Egypt and I NEED My BAG!!!!!!Guys, get in touch with meeeeee"
364,"On this pandemic scare in every part of the world, I traveled with my parents and a 5yrs old ,and a 7 moz old baby. We traveled with mask shield in a long hrs flight from USA - DXB , and 6 hrs of wait sweating n breathing difficulty parents who were exhausted and exhausted kids. We were at the edge of breaking down. Not corona just tiredness n crying crazy baby , my mom had headache n vomiting some what like travel sickness, the air hostess crew where so helpful n took so good care .I have never took time to review flight services before, I had been traveling regularly for 8+ yrs from USA - India. This team where outstanding n so courteous. This team stood apart. Yes!!! they were strict (but not rude), they kept insisting rules to stay safe, and addressed all the issues with careful listening, they didn't Jump concluding. My mom threw up again boarding the flight, they took good care of her with love n kindness, which I was really touched.  Even with my both tired kids. Thank you so much for the whole economy crew. Supervisor -she was cool and rocking lady with super captaincy, 100 % professional and compassionate leader she was , and so were her crew. Flight no: Ek 544Dxb- MAA Date- 26/06/2021Irene , Ibt issem, Valdir Campos, Daria, Mirko Vidal, dipshika Roy I got their names to write Abt them. Kudos to you and your awesome team.  Thank you 😊😊💞"
365,"Their customer service lady was rude and once I ask her to slow down to help me walk through and understand my itinerary, she got mad and told me to contact the travel agent. I simply asked to transfer the call to someone up the chain so that I can ask my question but she refused. I would not recommend travel with this airline and waste your money. Please stay away from them as their customer service folks are very rude and unsupportive."
366,"We received an email on 5/31 that our flight from Seattle to Dubai had been rescheduled a full 24 hours. This change, made only 6 days before our original flight, made the required Covid PCR test almost impossible to complete, as this was our honeymoon, and our first opportunity to get a test that would result in time would’ve been at 5:15pm - during our rehearsal dinner. The next day was consumed with wedding commitments and no time for covid testing, so we had to pay $552 the day after we got married to get PCR tests that would result in time. In addition, we were out an additional $512 for a nonrefundable night in a hotel room in Dubai. Emirates explained that they made this change to reflect a new weekly flight schedule pattern - an obvious move to save the company money. But they did so with no regard for their customers. We reached out to Emirates to see if they could reimburse us for the covid tests, or possibly upgrade us to business class for the lost hotel room, but they refused. That Emirates would not even attempt to honor our business is reprehensible. I have never experienced such poor customer service with an airline - first an outright refusal to help, then completely ignoring our follow-up request.  Beware booking any travel with Emirates. The good reputation that Emirates once enjoyed is a thing of the past. If they decide to delay or reschedule your flight for any reason, it will be at your expense."
367,"I had flight on Monday 6 th of June with Emirates from USA SAN FRANCISCO to Mumbai India,When I reached airport at 3:30  they asked me to fill self declaration form my flight timing was 5:00 PM.   I booked the flight in emergency because my mom was not feeling well in India.And I totally unaware about declaration form. I had my covid test with me.I redhead again airport at 4.15 with declaration form. One of my friend wants standing with airline officer who does checking.    And when I reached with set declaration form they said now flight is closed you can’t go with very very rude language.    There were more than 45 mins remaining.   One more this situation happened with me in emergency with different airlines  there was just 15 min left to take off but they allow me.   In this time I have explained them so many times my mom is not well I need to go but they said they can’t do anything even the senior officer was very rude and said bye to me.Their facial expressions was very unprofessional.    They don’t have any politeness. They are providing us service but their behavior is dengour than Immigration officer.Then again I have rebooked my flight and called customer care to reconfirm everything and asked him about set declaration form and he said no it’s not require you just need covid test only.    They only don’t know what they want or what they don’t want.    It’s a worst Airline service I have experienced. I will never travel with this Airline anymore.   Worst Service ever."
368,"Emirates hascancelled my flight 5 days before departure  and their customer service had no clue ,     they are not assisting at all .      please dont buy emirates these days they will cancel you 4 days before your flight"
369,"HAD A HOLIDAY BOOKED, CANCELLED DUE TO COVID 19 :((( REFUND STRAIGHT AWAY THANK U XXX"
370,"I have never had a more dismissive company. They were so rude on my 2 phone call. They do not want to go the extra yard. Very, very arrogant,  im"
371,"So far comparing Emirates airlines with the rest including BA, Easyjet, Ryanair, Wizzair - yes it's expensive but you get what you pay for. All flights I had with them were smooth and without any issues which would be worth mentioning. It's sad to see bad ratings/reviews as I didn't have issues getting a full refund due to covid and not able to fly to the destination location which banned travelling to the country (however I purchased a ticket with AMEX /credit card, so maybe it helped in my case.) I like option for big luggage so you don't have to worry for ""upgrading options"" if you do have heavy luggage. Again sorry to see other bad reviews, but for me - it's best airlines so far. Also I agree with the British customers who comparing Emirates with the British Airlines that BA is rubbish with international flights. Spot on."
372,"Got a faster flight reservation last weekend , I'm happy thanks"
373,"Despite making a booking with assurances of refunds, Emirates cancelled our flights, have not offered any alternatives and refuse to make the refunds. All they say is the that refunds are ""in the process"" but nothing happens for months. Used to fly regularly with them, but this is unacceptable behaviour from Emirates. Never again."
374,WOWZER - IM SHOCKED BY THE NEGATIVITY! I HONESTLY HAD A GREAT FLIGHT AND THEY WERE SUPER COVID CONSCIOUS AND THE AMAZING THING IS THEY GIVE YOU FREE TRAVEL INSURANCE COVERING COVID - NOW WHO ELSE DOES THAT.THE SERVICE IS ALWAYS SPOT ON AND THEY ALONG WITH QATAR AND TURKISH ARE PROBABLY THE BEST AIRLINES. ITS DEPRESSING BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO BE CHEERFUL ABOUT BA BUT INTERNATIONALLY THEY ARE AWFUL...MY COUNTRIES AIRLINE IS LETTING US DOWN..KEEP THE EXCELLENT WORK AT EMIRATES...
375,booked a flight of Israel because I was told by the staff at Emirates it was good to travel their and all I need was a PCR and Ministry of health document..but I actually needed 3 documents..so I wasn’t allowed in Dubai...they only asked for two documents at SFO to board the flight...they gave me a refund due to they’re inconvienice but took it back when I tried to fly back from Dubai to Sf for some odd reason...they said I was supposed to call and rebook the flight to go from Dubai to Sf which I did..and now they’re saying they can’t find that phone call to which I told one of theyre employees to rebook the flight...and they tell me just submit a complaint form...so they can just waist my time...told scam company...it’s really sad because I was really anticipating to leave amazing reviews for the flight...but this whole experience has been a nightmare..and I feel like I’m being bullied out of my money..so disgusting..I still can’t believe this is happening to me..I will continue to use my voice against this incidents until they do what’s right.
376,Best airline in the world IGNORE all the delayed compo reviews where is my money Iam entitled brigade they will all get their compo when its due perhaps those reviewers are from Liverpool?
377,I so surprised that a company as Emirates that use to be ranked best in the world can treat customers like this.We book fly and after lost the first trip cause covid we move forward to start claim the return fly.Since there calls mails all we can do... but not a real answer not a real follow up just automatic reply etc.... the last automatic reply say can not find our fly and can not refund. That is crazy.Not acceptable. Emirates please to contact me and help to finish this story.
378,Having travelled many times business class with Emirates we were disgusted to find ourselves abandoned in Thailand and our flights cancelled without any warning or attempt to contact us despite the fact we were loyal Members of the Emirates club and they had all contact details.It was impossible to contact them and we had problems getting any kind of reimbursement.A disgraceful company that should be ashamed of their customer service..
379,"The reason is because when i my journey started from ABQ, NM of USA, i did my COVID-19 test and it was negative 72 hours prior departure from my original  city, when i reached JFK, i had to stay 6 more hours waiting for my Emirates flight, i was literally the first person sitting in the gate (used the ticket issued in original airport), guess what? The employees said my test was not valid and it was expired! In very simple way they told me to book new ticket and forget about this ticket! i called my agency then i called Emirates to see what they can do for me, they said yes i have to pay for my ticket, then after i talked to their supervisor, they agreed to rebook me a ticket after 36 hours from my original flight, i had to book hotel in new york then i came back to airport, im still didnt checked in and i guess they will try to do something frustrating, one more thing, i suppose to land in Dubai at night and my next flight to my final destination will be after 22 hours, so, one more night to stay in Dubai, they were telling me i have to pay for my hotel too! Isnt that weird? How i stay more than 8 hours in airport on my own expenses, They were trying to take money in any possible mean, while they suppose to take care of their customers.In short form, this airlines has very rude crew, unprofessionally working, im saying that because they didnt help me and when i asked to talk to supervisor they didnt care, she was there and nobody told her that i need to talk to her, they did have Covid-19 test center in the airport, nobody told me that. Bad communication, bad crew and i will never every use there services in the future.  Try to fly with any airlines but Emirates."
380,"I Aliyu  Ladan Mohammed, here by writing to inform the general public that never use Emirates airlines due to their total inhumanity they expressed to me, I booked their flights on 29/01/2021 and was cancelled on the departure day,but up till no refund have been issued to me despite all the consultation since.For that I will never patronize Emirates flight for traveling to any where in the world. E-TICKET NO: 1763358260593"
381,I still haven't been refunded my ticket booked in January last year for a March flight cancelled due Covid. My travel agent went bust but CAA say Emirates need to pay me. That would be great. Sooner please.
382,Can't support a brand that backs KSE with more money to add to his stack and not invest and rip the soul out of Arsenal Football Club. #KreonkeOUT
383,"They sponsor Arsenal football clubs stadium, meaning they put money in the pockets of that leech Stan Kroenke. The same Stan Kroenke who wanted to launch a trophy hunting channel!! At a time where many animal species are becoming extinct, Mr Kroenke wanted to essentially flaunt that disgusting practice on TV."
384,"This is absolutely the worst airline I have ever been on, I don’t like this airline and Im never going to fly with this ever again. I’m flying with Etihad airways which is better than this shocking airline. Very poor 👎"
385,Wouldn't recommend to anyone. They also sponsor the Kroenke and because of this I won't fly Emirates anymore. #KroenkeOut
386,"Extremely poor and average, never again"
387,Wouldn't recommend to anyone. They also sponsor the Kroenke and because of this I won't fly Emirates anymore. #KroenkeOut
388,"I am very disappointed and very frustrated on how your staff in Tehran Iran handled our problem with damaged baggage. It has been more than 2 months and we called many time and nothing happened. And finally someone in Iran called They told my mom to go to the store which was far away from her house to pick up new bag and my mom went to the store and the store was closed bc on Corona Virus.I called again many timesAnd filled up more formsAnd they called my mom yesterday and tell her  to go to the store again in this corona situation and the store is still close. I am so angry about the service from tehran iran Emirate office .  Very rude too.I thought Emirates Airline was very good, more respectful , responsive and responsible toward their passengers base on Emirates reputation 😤😤😤😡😡 not happy with the people representing emirates Airline."
389,"The airline is great, BUT…..Recently got a offer to purchase more airmiles and get 100% extra for a limited time. I bought 25,000 miles with 25,000 free. Total 50,000 for £559. I tried to check a flight BHX-BKK return in november. Cost is £506. I tried to use my airmiles to find out those 50,000 air miles are worth only £200! Less than 40% of the £559 that i paid. Its very tempting to purchase airmiles, but for god’s sake DON’T do it. I contacted customer service chat and they said conversion is correct. The airline itself is great, if you earn the airmiles and spend them then its good value. But buying them in any offer its not worth it."
390,"Scammed me out of $700 for the next day’s flight after I had missed my previous flight.I didn’t know my passport needed a visa and they told me I would be fine with only my passport. I get there the next day, and they inform me that I am unable to board. No refund. I didn’t know I could dispute it If I had payed with a strong cc company. Awfully dishonest."
391,"By far the worst airlines I took compared to Lufthansa, British airways, Ethiopian airlines, egypt air, Saudi airlines, Turkish airlines, united airlines, delta, air Canada, gulf air, Air France and much more even Sudan air is better than Emirates. Avoid avoid avoidEspecially from Canada. the Toronto station are like bunch of kids running it avoid it. You better off waking for decades than taking this terrible airlines"
392,Worest experience in my life . They don't care about them customers.Very bed service!
393,The best services by Emirates. Thank u so much.
394,"Excellent and trusted. Once I left my camera in flight on transit. Emirates found, kept and sent it back to me. Al I needed to do was just to email them. Of course the camera was a expensive one. Thanks Emirates."
395,"The Emirates reward scheme has just told me that they  taken away 20,000 air miles rewards as I have not used them for three years. The shopping choices are terrible. The reward schemes gives you no upgrades. The best you could get is a kids watch for 20,000 air miles!!! This is a terrible reward scheme. Do not care about their customers. Virgin scheme is far better!!!! Worst reward scheme ever."
396,Our experience previously had been excellent however their total inability to communicate or give any thought to us in March 2020 causes me to warn others. We flew from UK to the Maldives no problem. During our vacation we noted Emirates cut some of their 4 daily flights but we heard nothing about our return flight scheduled for Friday 27th. The resort informed us 6 days before that all flights were being cancelled. No contact from Emirates. Resort contacted Emirates and was told it was our problem to get ourselves home or speak to the British Embassy! We booked and flew home with Etihad. Ok it's a pandemic but the struggle to get any refund from Emirates!! Finally they offered £300 only. We took it but there is the warning. If you think you can fly 2 people from Maldives to the UK or think Emirates are an excellent airline think again. Final comment we just booked to return to the Maldives with BA. Never again Emirates!
397,Emirates were brilliant in managing a cancelled flight during Covid-19. Even refunded miles. Really outstanding. Thank you!
398,No gud  service and no gud airline....that sums it up....they were good back in the days but now i will say...just avoid
399,Had the worst flight of my life! The flight was late(Not Emirates fault) so I missed my connection spent probably an hour in line to find out my next flight they put me up in a dirty hotel room
400,"Update below.Flight EK151 DXB-CPH 31. March.Nice aircraft, nice cabin crew, blocked middleseat due to Corona, nice service onboard.........All this overshadowed by a totally unacceptable delay (over 2 hours) due to the fact that Emirates decided to wait for passengers that did not have their travel documents for entry into Denmark in order. Seriously, just offload their bagage and depart ontime, how difficult can it be!!!!! Do not punish passengers that arrive on time and with correct documentation.Update: after replying to my initial complaint with a standard answer, Emirates has not responded to my follow up complaint. (Written more than a month ago). Terrible customer service."
401,"Our flights were cancelled due to the pandemic in March 2020. Emirates extended our tickets for two years, but now in 2021, it still looks like travel won’t be possible for a while so we requested a full refund of our tickets from Emirates. We got all our money back within one month from submitting the application, which was very simple to complete online. Other poor reviews had me worried, but Emirates handled it all very well."
402,One of the worst airlines .i will never use emirates airlines .corrupted  airlines who rubbed their passengers baggage. Ashamed of emirates company
403,Frequent flyer (skywards) program doesn’t work. No upgrades available never and your points get cancelled as you can’t use them on upgrades. It’s even worse than the plan from ethihad.
404,"It has been a year since Emirates let us down big time,We were in Dubai visiting friends when we heard that our flight back to Manchester was cancelled.What do we do! telephone Emirates but no help from the booking staff so we got onto the internet and was informed there were no seats left,the only seats available were in business class.The price was £3,300 each and flying to London Heathrow not Manchester so we had to pay for a Taxi £400.00 so £7.000 in all.The hardest part was to get our money back from Emirates it was very clear that we were not going to get a reimbursement from them,After many emails to Emirates  we never got a reply from them,a small amount of money was paid to us the amount of money was poultry not the full cost of a return ticket.Till this day we have never had an apology or a sorry from the airline that put us into debt as pensioners we feel very let down.The only help we got was from AXa travel insurance who were fantastic at dealing with our claim.We had to pay a lot of money for a poor service the lounge was closed for First class and business class and the rear cabin bar was closed.Why would we want to go back to Dubai which is run by a dictator where people go missing permantly.Horses are treated better than people who live there where is the Dictators Daughter ask if you dare.This story is a true reflection on the way they treat there own family and guests to Dubai.Shame on you what goes around comes around.."
405,Some scumbag staff at checkin desks and boarding gates Sack them you anuses
406,"Booked a flight to Dubai and Bahrain for work, had to cancel last minute due to a colleague getting positive COVID test, online form completed in 5 mins for refund, in my bank 4 days later. Have used Emirates for years, best by far."
407,"Lovely flight out to Japan, staff brilliant, return cancelled due to covid, understandable, however no voucher, no refund - because it seems we made the mistake of booking our flights through a travel agent which subsequently went out of business."
408,"EMIRATES first demolished my brandnew suitcase (Rimova Aluminum), then got upset about having to fix or replace it  and then lost it. After taking loss report: no more reaction from EMIRATES. Today, after 31 calls... they claim that i travelled without luggage and the baggage claim check cant be my own. In flight staff is rude.  minimal service on intercontinental travel, broken entertainment system, 3hr delay and not a single apology.Their staff is rude, lazy and unprofessional.Some gay steward hit on me.The food is gross swinefeed.Emirates = The devil's airline straight to and from hell!"
409,Always use emirates to fly first class the a380 is the best experience I’ve had. The staff are extremely professional and presentable will only use emirates where I can!
410,Booked tickets online through Emirates and they cancelled it and when we asked to reschedule it so they asked us to pay extra charges to rebook or making any changes. 1/10 and customer service is very poor and not helpful and during covid they should help but they aren’t very helpful.
411,"Our return flight from Auckland to Glasgow on 1 April 2020 was cancelled due to Covid.  We requested a refund and were provided with an offer of a  voucher....Three complaints, each of which received a conflicting response, and 5 months later Emirates confirmed in late October we would receive 50% refund within 90 days.  Late January 2021 still no refund so 4th complaint submitted - no response after 2 weeks.  Mid-February email sent to Sir Tim Clark, Emirates CEO - no response.  Simply dreadful customer service."
412,"Anyone downvoting Emirates needs their head tested.Excellent crew, phenomenal value for money flying to the East, good quality food, good seat and space and the ICE system is decent.What more do people want from an airline?"
413,"I have travelled with Emirates for years. It has bad days for sure, but overall one of the best airlines in the world. Danger always there for complacency. Reputation definitely hit by Covid. Money return policy definitely showed the company valued itself over its customers. A little 'unconventional' in how it retained passenger money for well over 6 months by rewriting terms and conditions. Longer if it could get away with it and passengers did not chase. Will take a long time for some of us to forget. Likely to have forgiven before forgotten - but Emirates will need to really return to form quickly."
414,"We were told only at the airport that our flights are cancelled and there was no information given to us regarding the cancellation. Their customer service is really poor and lot of communication gap, their staff are not helpful and we are suffering because of them. Lots of stress and pressure put on us. We called Emirates customer care every time during the booking and no one cared to tell that they are not operating. It’s really pathetic and horrible, we went through the covid tests and all the documentation pain and at the last minute we are told that we cannot fly. Really frustrating experience and worst service. We are awaiting for our refund and no one contacted us yet after we have raised a formal complaint on this. We are really worried and disappointed. Our entire family is affected because of this. We are not going to use their flights anymore."
415,Terrible customer service. Requested refund in November but still no luck. Someone contacted me in December saying that it will processed in 7 working days but that didn’t happen. Two weeks ago same guy send me an email saying that it will be transfers next day but nothing happened. I raised a complaint and someone contacted me saying that “let me check with the team and I will contact you as soon as I hear from them”. But after that no response even after chasing them couple of times. Worst thing they don’t even respond to emails
416,"Rude and miserable customer service advisor at check in in Heathrow named Laura. Dismissive, unapologetic, unhelpful and rude."
417,"Great service as always from the world's best airline. Best seating, top entertainment on ICE and no one comes close to their food. Hub in Dubai is awesome"
418,"Emirates notified us in July 2020 that they had made fundamental changes to our flights for a trip in Sept 2020. The changes meant that half our party could not travel so the entire trip had to be cancelled.  They said they would automatically process the flight refunds within 2 months (?) but that I would need to manually apply for seat booking refunds which would take up to 90 days (?).  I followed their very specific instructions and reluctantly awaited the refunds.  After 90 days nothing happened.  I called Emirates customers services to be told that our refund applications had been incorrectly submitted.  I advised that they were submitted on line, in real time, following instructions from one of their colleagues.  The agent dismissed my protestations, claiming that I must have messed up....... despite me providing contrary evidence!!!!?  in short I had to submit all refund requests again  - bizarrely following exactly the same process as first time.  Make your own mind up on who messed up.  In all it took 5 months to refund the costs.... over £1000.  In short Emirates customer services are appalling, choosing to cover their own backsides rather than hold their hands up.  Never again - there are many other airlines that are eager for my custom."
419,"Very unhappy with their customer service!!they give the image to the world as they were a top class as they have A-380 jumbo planes, but their service and after service is horrible, rude and not acceptable!!"
420,"great service from Emirates with all the CV related ticket changes we needed being done quickly and easily via the chat service, for free! got us home at short notice when the Uk rules changed and the eco fares are very low, so im happy with Emirates doing the best they can in challenging times."
421,We were stuck in Tanzania when our carrier Emirates was banned from flying in to the UK. Emirates help desk in Tanzania and particular Miss Amal Mussalam put us at total ease and supported us in our darkest day. She sorted all our flights at no extra cost whatsoever and booked us with alternative airlines who were not banned from UK landing. We a family of five would like to thank considerate Emirates airlines and in particular the staff miss.Amal Mussalam. Thanks for your help and support.
422,"Everything a airline should be. I was shocked to see a few negative comments as personally I have none. Staff are courteous, pleasant and treat you nicely despite which class you are travelling in. You need to use a airline like Turkish to appreciate how well you are treated with Emirates. I flew into Dubai with Emirates and due to UK shutting down direct flights I was unable to get back with them. They tried damn hard to get me back via Dublin and Germany but couldn’t accommodate us before the hotel quarantine kicked in. They have kept my ticket open to use in 2 years now. I had to fly back by Turkish. Worst experience ever. Thank you Emirates for not being like Turkish Airlines."
423,"They cancelled our flight home from New Zealand last March.We requested to be booked with another airline, this was not available. Our only alternative was to purchase flights home with Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic at a cost of almost £3000 for 2 of us.Emirates have since repeatedly refused to reimburse us for our replacement flights.Never again.Awful customer service."
424,Excellent Service. I had 7 different flights booked with Emirates between October 2020 and March 2021.Applied for refund due to Covid situation.Had to fill an online form.was sent immediate confirmation of the form received and full refunds were credited to my card account within 7 days of sending the form.Awesome Service
425,I wanted to say how happy I have been with Emirates and how they have worked through my issues with my cancelled ticket between UK and New Zealand.  I can't wait till the borders open and I'll be able to fly out of NZ again.
426,"Emirates behave shocking when they cause problems. I turned up at the airport to find they had cancelled my flight (flight wasnt cancelled but overbooked, second leg of my journey), they never notified me, put me on a flight for two days later, shrugged there shoulders and walked off. No notice at all given, i forked out for taxis, i had rented my home out so i had nowhere to stay, Emirates did nothing.There customer complaints make pathetic excuses. The CAA have written several times to them about my case and Emirates ignore them as well. The CAA have awarded in my favour but i will now have to go too Court to get the money i am due by law for cancelling my flight without notifying me and also failing to take care of me. Emirates attitude is they have no duty of care to any of its customers.Disgraceful company."
427,Following an aborted trip in March 2020 we had 2 partially used tickets (return to UK from New Zealand).It's now the 31/01/2021 and Emirates have still not returned our money despite 7-8 online submissions.Apparently there 'Customer Service' department cannot speak to the the 'Refunds' department who themselves are no customer facing.You never know how good an airline is until something goes wrong...in this case 'inept' doesnt even begin to cover it
428,"Flight cancelled on day of departure for “operational reasons” (they hadn’t sold enough seats due to change in boarder rules due to COVID).  booked on a replacement to a different city in the same country and told I’d have to sort out and pay for my own way to final destination. Asked if they cooks rebook via a connecting flight (int then domestic) and told no cause the domestic is not an emirates flight. Whilst COVIF is affecting all airlines, and I can understand the flight cancellations to not properly reroute or even offer to pay fkr  train ticket when purchased a flexible business class ticket is appalling. Worst airline going, even Ryanair is this bad."
429,"Very bad service, emirates is becoming worst airline.couple of years they were the best ones but now they are losing quality.On emirates website its mentioned all tickets are covered for insurance and there is free change and refund until jun 2021.Booked tickets and after couple of days emirates cancel flight and changed my flight, now with changed flight, I have 8 hours and 10 mins transit time at Dubai airport. Travelling with infant and toddler so its very difficult to travel with such a long transit time. Emirates not offering lounge or hotel accommodation saying its only for 10+ hours transit passengers.Now trying to cancel my ticket and they are deducting £80 on ticket and saying its non refundable tax."
430,"I flew with Emirates from Heathrow to Bangkok on the 15th of November. I was allowed to board at Heathrow where the staff member admitted he did not know what documents I needed because of Covid. Both boarding passes were issued. When I arrived at Dubai they then scrutinised the documents in detail and told me that I did not have the right visa. If this was the case, why was I allowed to fly to Dubai. I have since complained to them and heard nothing. Avoid Emirates and Dubai and rather go on Qatar where they are nicer to travel with. It seems that Emirates and Dubai have got so big and powerful they seem to think they can do anything they like. I then had to fly back to London and besides the wasted expense and time, I should be compensated for the negligence at Heathrow. They cannot half way down the reject passengers and say ""Oh well now we will really scrutinise all the documents"". Why is this not done at the source airport. I have heard many people this has happened to,  because of the chaotic management at Emirates. Yes your planes are great. But your service sucks. Having great planes and crap service is just not good enough. Also added to this that if you say anything in Dubai you feel they will just throw you in jail and throw away the key. I will never fly with Emirates again. And good riddance to them and their expensive island state."
431,The airline cancelled our flights and I requested a refund.  Our refund requests were processed on 12/14/20 but the amounts have not been credit to my card yet.  They have not responded to any of  my emails inquiring on the refunds.
432,"i have milles which i want to transfer to a friend of mine, when i want to transfer 25k milles they wanted to charge me same value of milles which is 600USD ?What the point of this service if i am going to pay 600usd and my milles valued 600usd, where is LOGIC here ??They are really funny and though we are that dumb we will pay for that."
433,Very respectful company. Very flexible. Dealt with them many times and got full refunds when the problem was out of my hands. Their flights are very comfy and well serviced. I would totally recommend
434,"Flew with Emirates over the holidays and couldn't praise them more. Flight was great, service was excellent, food on both flights was really good. The best thing though, was how well they dealt with covid. Super efficient and organised. Took the worry off my shoulders because they had everything covered."
435,"I have been flying to Dubai for many years and having tried various airlines but the one I keep coming back to is Emirates and have even got a Skywards reward card. I have never even thought to check them out on Trustpilot as I have never had a bad experience so I am really shocked to find so many negative reviews. The overall flying experience is excellent. Wherever possible I book direct with Emirates and on the last 2 occasions when my family and I were due to fly to Dubai in June and very recently for Christmas, both trips were cancelled due to COVID. Emirates refunded me within days without any issues. Cannot recommend them enough."
436,Zero stars should be awarded. They are refusing to give a refund for tickets bought through Travelgenio. Neither of these two companies is budging each saying it's the responsibility of the other to issue the refund. Was due to fly in March and must have made nearly 100 calls to both of these companies but still no refund or resolution.  Absolutely disgusting.  Their advise was to get a lawyer! Fuming!
437,Beware of Refund policy.I cancelled my trip to Dubai due to pandemic and Emirates totally failed to refund my money after provision of required documents.I read many negative reviews of refund so I'm not the only one....
438,"The 5 stars are purely down to Julia in Manchester who helped amend flights for me.Her efficiency, patience, transparency and ability to go above and beyond really speaks volume of her character and willingness to do the right thing.Julia in Manchester you are a credit to Emirates, I hope they value the VIP service you offer customers, thankyou again x"
439,"I booked Emirates flight from London to Melbourne and got an upgrade to business class for 600$ and used it and I believe business class in Emirates is worth the gross price you pay for it. Great food, cool service and everything is amazing"
440,"Things have not got any better with Emirates I can see the complaints are still coming in.It is a shame that an airline can go from excellent to bad in such a short time.We had the the most horrendous experience any frequent flyer could go through,they could not care at all for there fare paying passengers.We had to pay £6000.00 plus taxis fares to get home from Dubai after they cancelled our flight no reimbursement no contact Terrible after sales staff.Our original economy tickets were paid less 30% after countless emails,it was no good trying to call them on the telephone it would of been easier to talk to the Pope.The only saving grace was AXA travel insurance they were caring helpful staff who paid us the money Emirates failed to do.I see Emirates have gone up to 2 stars now I do not know how because the complaints have gone up.If anyone flying with Emirates in the future please cover your back side with every eventuality that could happen while in the hands of Emirates."
441,Never again. Their link with Emirates Holidays robbed me of over £1100 when I asked to move my holiday booked through Emirates Holidays. Totally inflexible approach during pandemic. People don’t forget.
442,"Had so many bad experiences so stopped counting.- luggage delayed and they did not care- flight cancelled from them and I had to book another myself to get home.- refund was less than expected and took 8 months but they still haven not paid for the replacement flightThey are a dreadful airline and I would basically fly any other but then now even though they are cheap. If you can avoid, avoid!"
443,"Definitely one of the best airlines out there. Once you try emirates, you will not want to go back to any other airline. Their personal service is just on a different level, at least in my opinion."
444,"Beware! If you have Emirates Skywards miles and not been able to use them in their 3year period due to a serious illness you will lose them. This company does not care about your illness, they care about making money regardless of the consequences. Emirates please stop making adverts that does not mirror you as a company. TOO SAD"
445,flight was canceled from bangkok to birminham uk due to the covid  was offered another flight into london fist class and they would only charge me £5000 for 2 0f us!we asked about getting on other flights was told all full sorry!! cost me 1200 uk pounds to fly back with thai air WILL NEVER USE EMIRATES AGAIN...i did get a refund 0f 100 uk pounds each for a flight that cost 300 uk pounds each....one BIG joke...once over seas these guys dont give a dam....ps just make sure you have a good credit card if using these you might need to rebook to get home.
446,I will not book with Emirates again. We travelled with them last year and had lots of issues with the flight which was diverted and the way they dealt with it and the customer service was dreadful plus the response to a later complaint wasn't good either. Nonetheless I booked through and agent for June this year and obviously was unable to go. I moved the holiday to November with the hope of going then. However they changed the flights so we had one less day from a 7 day holiday and 19hour layover so were offered a cancellation. We did cancel with the uncertainty but have now been waiting 14 weeks for a refund and they have had my £4k since February. Its ridiculous and I would not recommend or use them.
447,It was ok from London to Dubai when i travelled from Dubai it was horrific in lounge as nobody kept social distance(long queues) and Emirates did not request to any of passenger. They lie in advertisement of social distancing also inflight service was not as good as in reviews. it was bad experience than Qatar airways.
448,"Booked with Emirates on Friday 20th November 2020 from Glasgow to Bangkok. As I arrived in Bangkok to collect my 2 Lugguages, one a suitcase and another a box.  I came to find my box sitting by itself on a trolley on its side. Despite the box fully sealed reinforced with duck tape all around the edges for extra strength and support box with visable signs of ""Fragile"" and ""This Way Up"" Signs and writing imprinted all around the box, with additional box content written on the outside, the box was ripped on top, bottom and sides! (Luckily I managed to take some pics before opening up the box to inspect) Which can only be seen as the total disregard and respect of a passengers lugguage! At first I thought customs and immigration had opened up and inspected the box, but when I didn't see the normal signs and labelling from them that they had done so that made me angry that somebody blantantly ripped opened the duck tape and the box and did not even bother to seal it back for whatever reason, deeming the items in the box could have been tampered with! I have flown with emirates in many occassions and within the 10+ of years flying with them I have always valued their service and have never had any problems. However, this was the first time I felt they have let customers down and felt that strongly about it that I had to issue a formal complaint to them. After complaining to Emirates with the exact same photos attached with this post, highlighting the content had been written on the side of the box, I received a response by a Mr Hafiz Imdadullah from customer affairs through email reminding and advising me that fragile items should be robustly packed in accordance with their ""Conditions of Carriage"", which emirates were not liable for damage to or loss of fragile items with or without their knowledge. To which he also felt the need to direct me to article 8.3.3.  He added insult by including, ""passengers must ensure that the checked baggage is sufficiently robust and well secured to withstand the usual and normal rigours of carriage by air without sustaining damage"". And further adds more insult with, ""Nevertheless, we appreciate your concerns and I wish to assure you that your feedback has been of benefit to us"". ""We appreciate  your patronage as a valued Emirates Skywards member and look forward to welcoming you on board our flights again""  Now, if that is not the most patronizing response, then I don't know what is!I wish trustpilot would allow you to attach the pics I took to show how badly damaged the box was!I responded to that email explaining to them how I disagreed with their justification and believe that in this case I was unfairly treated and it was unfair and unjust that they would expect a paying customer to understand how the operations of lugguage handling. I also further reiterated my box was fully sealed (taped up and secured) with indicators throughout the box. It has now been over 2 weeks since I sent that response and I have yet to receive a response from them. Is this the kind of care we are expected of the new norm from Emirates?!"
449,Unethical Practice. These people say they're offering a full refund but still deduct almost 30% of the cost of the ticket for a flight that THEY CANCELLED. Dishonest and illegal.
450,"I have been waiting 9 months for a refund of prepaid seats booked though emirates.com, which they cancelled the return flight due to covid. they are great when everything is going well but as soon as a problem arises they try and pass you from one department to another, very frustrating."
451,"Its should b minus star, it has been more then 11 month they didnt refund my amount, i am littrally feeling begger as i am msging them again n again its pathetic to think but what to do as it is my hard earns i cant let it go."
452,"Do not trust Emirates or even fly them!! My wife and I traveled from Phuket to Dubai in March 2020 on Emirates and the intention was to spend 4 days in Dubai before heading back to London. But had to change the flight straight back to London on arrival to Dubai as a result of the pandemic and a lot of countries were shutting down it's boarders. We arrived London and realized my luggage was not on the flight. This was our wedding anniversary trip and we had exchanged some presents and all. We reported the case to Emirates and they assured us the suitcase will be sent to us in a couple of days.First of all the customer service is horrible for an airline like this, they were all rude and no curtesy or whatsoever. This is not our first time flying them and I have always told friends and family members how much I like the airline.Up till this very moment, we still have not been sent our luggage. The airline saying we should provide the receipt for all the contents in the suitcase. How can I find all that when a few items there were purchased a year or more ago, receipts of the presents we exchanged were bought cash and also in the suitcase missing. We have a rough estimate of about £4000 content in the suitcase. The most annoying thing was they offering to pay us $500 in compensation if we cannot provide the receipts.Going through our travel insurance to get the claim and it's also a whole new story now.Do not trust Emirates or even fly them. I have all the time in the world to fight till I get my suitcase back or get a compensation to cover all the contents. Criminals."
453,"I wish that there's a minus 5 stars. They don't even deserve one star.The people in Dubai are animals. They talk from their noses. Once you there, you are in a jungle. No law, no rights, no rules (unless you are a slim blonde girl with blue eyes).If you have a claim, guess what? They only give you a link. Can you believe that? You basically in the HQ (Dubai) and they can't be bothered to get a team for complaints.My issue was that, I flew from Europe on a connecting flight. In Dubai, they refused to take one of my luggages (which was already in the first flight). That's why I said it's a jungle there."
454,"We booked and paid for an international flight ticket in March 2020. Due to Covid, the flight could not take place. We were advised by Emirates that we would receive a refund into our bank account- in July 2020. It is now November- 9 months, and even with many calls to this airline, we have still not received the refund due! Simply put, this is theft, and goes against international regulations!"
455,"terrible the way they have dealt with refunds, managed to get just under half the value of my ticket cost back after 7 months.they are just a organised gang with solicitors to protect them they think its acceptable to keep over 300 pound they were once a great airline now they are common thieves."
456,I had previously written a glowing report for Emirates on 19th October when they told me my refund had been processed and would be in my account 3 - 5 workings days.  Not yet received and I have asked them to confirm 3 times where the money has been sent.  They have not given me this information and I am worried.  I travel quite a bit with them but I will have to rethink in the future.
457,"Emirates use to be good, its rubbish now, canceling holidays & flights with no notice or communication and toke 10 weeks to get refunds.Avoid  !!"
458,"Great service. Friendly staff, really helpful and great journey from beginning to end. I am a regular flyer and will always use Emirates."
459,"It has been a nightmare from start to end, and now they didnt even refund for my totally bulked luggage, that even if the staff promised me it was ok.The Iteo pr agency told med to wait and even said it was ok.Tina Tharaldsen in Iteo knows, that after 14 days I will have no rights to claim.This is a wellknown strategy even Morris( which reclaim destroyed luggage) and former employee in the Emirates knows, so I was specific warned about this certain issue. Bottom line is that if something goes wrong you re in a deep problem.It s impossible to get contact with the Emirates, and even if you do, it might be with a polish, spanish, russian( lowpaid..) who hardly speak/understand proper english.., AND they dont log anything so the next time you re getting in contact, you ll have to start from zero again.The Emirates strategy as the arabian generally mentality is wellknown for promising, big smile and tell/convince you that everything will be fine, UNTIL the day come when you dont have any rights more to claim. They just hope it will goe away..They lie and even threaten you if you say any negative about the country/airline.REMEMBER: This is a airline company owned and totally monitored by the arabian goverment which stands for modern slavery, women abuse, misleading and frauding naive tourist and so on so on..Nothing is like they want us to believe! Behind the fasade its torture, unlegally arrestment of tourist, women get raped and then gets to prison and denied their passport. And if you complain, you will either get a huge fine, arrested or even killed. The end of the story, after Iteo/Emirates was informed of my feedback here in trustpilot, I got an email from the headoffice( which I couldnt reply) that I by criticism the company in public, I automatically was taken of my rights to claim. That they already had promised me it by txt msg and I aldo had a travel quaranteed with Emirates, didnt seem to so important🙈🙈🙉🙈🤪The standard on business class is also mention very outdated if you compare to KLM , Singapore Airlines and Quatar airways."
460,"Had a flight in May 2019 from Bangkok to Amsterdam (via Dubai of course). After 3 hours on board of the plane in 35 degrees Bangkok it returned to the gate : mechanical issue of the plane). After another 3 hours waiting at the gate the flight was cancelled completely meaning I also missed the connecting flight from Dubai to Amsterdam). Not a word from Emirates for new flight details. I had to find out myself on the App on my cellphone.  No mails, no calls,  no nothing. Yes they took me to a hotel in Bangkok. That's it. I had to find out myself about my new flightdetails. Emirates owes me € 600,00 but all they offered after at least 10 emails/reminders were a couple of lousy miles. Their 'Customer Service' is the worst I ever experienced. Emirates just ignoring your emails / claims"
461,"I have been traveling for 13Years with Emirates long haul UK to Hk 2or 3 times a year and other short trips in between. They always have amazing customer service their a flight crew go a alive and beyond. One one trip I went home because my dad passed away, when Emirates found out they upgraded my return flight. This year due to Covid I had a flight Cairo to Tokyo canceled. I had a full refund very fast. Brilliant company who I will continue to use."
462,Great move by Emirates to provide free covid19 cover for passengers booking on their flights!
463,"Disgusting service. Long time customer for over 12 years , flying 2 or 3 times a year.  Bangkok flight to UK cancelled twice (cancelled flight, rebooked following day then cancelled again). Tried in vain to contact via phone , twitter, live webchat. Totally ignored. No answer on phone or twitter and cut off livechat. Twitter account was very active updating showing all positive happy stories. Meanwhile stuck in thailand on an expired visa and no flight, was completed ignored. I was very lucky to find another flight with British Airways at cost of £550. Only waited 6 months for the return leg refund which was £198.  Emirates really showed how they don't give damn about customers. Have put up with them in past as lower price and convenient flight times, but never again."
464,I would like to say what excellent service I received in cancelling my flights the refund email said it could take 90 days to process 1 took about a week and the other 3 weeks which is better than I could have ever expected. I am only sorry I am not able to use the flights but with Covid it isn’t possible for us.
465,"Always had a great experience with Emirates and pleased to say no issues in getting a refund on flights to India via Dubai in November. From asking for a refund to physically receiving it in my bank account has only taken just over 2 weeks.  Really feel for those who are struggling, whether it was different for us as booked direct with Emirates rather than through a 3rd party I’m not sure"
466,"Two months, still no refund. Not okay."
467,I am extremely disappointed in such a highly respected airline that it takes 90 days to refund on a flight I was unable to take due to COVID 19 pandemic. Why are Emirates holding onto my money for so long. I appreciate they are dealing with a significant backlog but this is ridiculous. Customer Services have assured i will receive a full refund in 90 days.
468,"I've travelled with Emirates several times in the past and quite enjoyed the flight (despite the check in staff occasionally being stuck up). We'd booked an all inclusive honeymoon to Mauritius with Emirates via their own website early this year. The trip cost us almost £4000, however once UK lockdown kicked in, Emirates told us they had to cancel our trip and would issue a credit note. 4 weeks later we recieved a credit note which we didn't request or want. On the terms and conditions it stated that we could request a refund from September onwards, which didnt make sense because our trip was ATOL protected and per ATOL requirements they were legally required to provide a refund after July. We waited patiently but in August faced slightly difficult times so we requested a cash refund. We got a response on 23rd August stating that our refund had been approved and the money would take 8 weeks to get back to us. It will be a full 8 weeks in 4 days and we have still not received any money back or any further emails stating delays. We've now had to chase again. I receive countless emails from Emirates promoting holidays but can't get a refund for the one they cancelled.I thought it would be better to book direct and easier to get money back but clearly I was wrong. We've had our money back from RyanAir and easyJet within weeks, Emirates has taken almost 8 months and still nothing.*update* slight update from my initial post, we received a refund a day after emailing them again but they've deducted £200 from the refund which was our deposit for a holiday they cancelled! Fuming isnt even the right word to use. So so so disappointed with Emirates, certainly will never be flying with them again, would much rather fly budget and know im not being ripped off."
469,"I've flown Emirates numerous times and my experience with them has always been pleasant. The service on board has always been incredible and the cabin crew are always professional, kind and attentive. I would highly recommend EK to anyone."
470,"Seems we are not alone in our experience of getting a refund on a part used ticket. They gave us £515.90 each on business class tickets from Bangkok to Birmingham. Not even half the ticket price. This can’t be legal will be getting some advice, and so should all the people affected by this. Terrible treatment of loyal customers."
471,I booked directly via Emirates.com and got credits to book for next time. For anyone complaining here I recommend you learn a lesson and don't use booking agents.
472,Booked via BudgetAir for flights on the 2nd April. £4000 worth of flights. Refund requested yet Emirates still are to refund my travel agent. Emirates refuse to speak to me. This is now ridiculous! Give me my money back!
473,"Emirates cancelled the flight a couple of days before departure. This was not convenient, so I requested a refund. The refund was requested on 3rd September 2020 and funds were received on 2nd November 2020.When a customer pays for a service, they pay immediately. If the service cannot be provided, funds should be returned immediately to the customer. No company has the right to hold funds from a customer after failing to provide a service. This is immoral and in the near future laws should be put in place to prevent this. COVID-19 is NOT an excuse to not refund someone swiftly.""Due to the current situation relating to COVID-19, we are experiencing severe delays in processing times.""- This is an interesting explanation. Perhaps it's so that Emirates can boost their financial health by hanging onto people's money? One always receives a quick response on the Live Chat service on their website. So, if they can afford to employ people to do that, I am sure they have the manpower to issue a refund.Emirates state that it takes 90 days to issue a refund. If you think this is acceptable, by all means, feel free to book with Emirates. If, however, you agree with me that this is unacceptable, you may wish to look elsewhere.If I had an airline, I would be ashamed to see the feedback I see here on Trust Pilot. I hope they redeem their status by addressing the feedback."
474,"Lots of negative comments, so Emirates airline time to think about how bad treating those customers even 4 of us from march they cancelled our flight and we were stuck in Thailand. We waiting over 6 months for refund and only get 25% money back. Horrible experience with Emirates and still waiting our money. But in the whole world millions airline much much better than Emirates."
475,They cancelled my flights during my holidays offering no solution and further they charged me cancellation fees. Never fly with Emirates!!
476,they cancelled my flight in march due to covid 19 and left us stranded in the Maldives. It has taken 6 months and a refund of £348 has been given2 people from male to dubai then 2 people from dubai to Manchester. So just over £80 per flight each. I wish!They have penalised me for only using a partial ticket. Will never fly with this 2 bit company again. No wonder they are the biggest airline they are robbing their customers blind
477,"I fly since 2007 with Emirates and I am a very happy customer. Always FC and the service is amazing. Either if I fly to SA or Middle East or Russia, all the flights are a great experience. Thank you Emirates for more then 10 years having me on board and giving me a great UX. - Erwin Jager"
478,"Found a gem in Bojana Emirates Customer Service.I needed to change my planned holiday dates to Dubai due to Covid 19.  I had phoned Customer Service 3 times ( with a long wait to be answered each time ) each time they looked at details of the amount of work needed to change the Flights and Hotel, I was simply cut off ! ( I was getting very annoyed ) The next time I phoned I was connected to Bojana . What a difference she was extremely helpful and sorted out all the changes needed and sent me confirmation email within minutes of the call ending. I was so relieved to have found BOJANA !  I will ask for her again the next time I call.  Anthony Pope"
479,"Received a credit towards my next flight after having to go with a few hoops.  Understandably with Covid going on, people need to lighten up."
480,"Rude staff, who always make problems.. I do not recommend !"
481,THE WORST AND T-WAT AIRLINE EVER SEEN STILL WAITING FOR A REFUND FROM MARCH . THEY DONT EVEN RESPONDING TO THE REFUND PROCESS . F-UCKING P-RICKS . PIECE OF S-HIT
482,"Would love to leave a zero and that is a complaint about the review website also. Put a zero in. Was bumped off a flight with one weeks notice to Perth. Been trying to get on promise after promise after promise. The cap in WA has been lifted by 200, I am on a priority wait list, no doubt with thousands of others, and Emirates still cannot tell me with one week to go if I am on the flight. They say, and I do not believe a word, the government have not informed them of the new cap. Suggested they check the internet and then be pro-active and contact the government themselves. So, they moan they are flying empty and when the cap increases they delay being pro-active notwithstanding you have to get a COVID test before you fly. So with less than a week to go, now looking unlikely I’ll be able to go. Calling is a waste of time so my next stop, Court for breach of contract."
483,"Wish I could give zero stars. Emirates cancelled my flight from Perth to BHX via Dubai ... but not my outbound flight Filled in refund form .. finding it was a bloody nightmare in itself, they do not make it easy. Chased and followed up by phone and via online chat - usual scripted response, no compassion ‘we’re sorry, were busy’ blah blah blah .. I sympathise with any business affected by this pandemic, I work for one myself.. I’m sure lots of us do.. but to be told I have to wait 3 months for a £1500 refund? I don’t think so. Apparently my refund has been processed and authorised... that was at the beginning of September.. it’s now the 21st and no sign of it. Even more annoyingly, it’s the only remaining balance on my credit card which I obviously have to keep paying for... so if the refund ever land, it’ll put me in credit with a card I no longer want and am waiting to cancel.I will NEVER book with emirates again after this ... their communication has been seriously lacking and their ‘support’ and customer service is horrendous.Jet2holidays have been far better than emirates .. even Ryanair are more cooperative"
484,Useless in all departments. Avoid this company or you risk losing your money when things go wrong
485,"Flight cancelled because of Covid back in March - no help at the time, if you could even get through to them that is.Requested refund back in July.Many complaints and emails and yet still no refund, this is what they replied back at the start of August:Thanks for your email. I can confirm that we're processing your refund. I can't give you a definite time frame when we'll complete it though. We have severe delays, as we're getting a lot of requests due to the outbreak. You'll get an email confirmation once done. Please allow us some more time. I appreciate your patience.I'm here to help with any other questions. Although other airlines refunded me almost immediately (because I had to book many flights to get home which were also cancelled) Emirates is as yet, unwilling to return my money.Shocking airline, I will never book with them again!UPDATE:From April to July I had been trying to get what should be a simple answer to a question, which was, what is the value of my refund or travel voucher? Calls to the number in the UK were no help as all they kept telling me that they couldn't tell me what the refund would be. I would have to use the travel voucher request on the Emirates website, very frustrating! They had no trouble taking my money but couldn't tell me what a refund value was. Like I was asking them to build a rocket and fly me to the moon. So, on July 17, 2020 after submitting the request I was told my refund would be exactly £219.65. Fed up with this whole ordeal I decided to take the refund and be done with them. Incidentally, my original ticket cost £728.28, meaning my one-way flight to Sydney cost over £500... Great. How they work this out is beyond me.. Then, after waiting for months and complaining several times that I hadn't been refunded I finally received and automated refund email on September 28, 2020 and guess what.... They refunded me £197.15! What an incompetent company they really are. I have again complained and at the time of writing this I am waiting for an explanation on how they have suddenly come up with a lesser refund than originally promised. So far I have received this from Emirates ""The events that you have described are being looked into and a member of our Customer Affairs Team will write to you once our review is complete.""I assume this will take several months. When I get a reply, if I do, I will update.Would love to hear from anyone else who has had the same experience.."
486,Please. It's almost 3 months and still I didn't receive my refund. A friend of mine received her refund already for not more than a month. Please be fair.
487,Cancelled my return flight within 48 hours from Thailand with no assistance in getting home. Had to fork out another emergency flight which cost more than double. Still no refund from emirates and really disappointed as this is the first time using them. Looks like it will be the last! Still waiting from March...
488,Don't trust them. Ridiculous to wait 90 days until Emirates solves a matter caused by them.
489,"I'm absolutely shocked. I didn't fly on my return flight in April from Mumbai to Manchester for obvious reasons. At the time I chose to keep my ticket open for future use.Now it's pretty obvious that I won't be travelling to India any time soon, and as my 2 years runs out in September 2021 I decided to apply for a refund.Sooo- I am told that as I used a 1 way flight, the cost of a current 1 way flight will be deducted from what I originally paid - leaving a grand total of £122 to claim back for my unused return flight.I didn't book a 1 way flight - I booked a return and yes I understand the return leg is cheaper when booking together rather than 2 x 1 ways flights. BUT where can I buy a flight from Mumbai to Manchester for £122. And it will take 90 DAYS!!THEN, in the Fare conditions - it looks like my penalty for cancelling an Economy flight is £200.WHAT? So, now I owe you money???Absolute RIP OFF and SCAM. I am absolutely disgusted with this, I shouldn't have any penalty to pay - YOU cancelled the flight - NOT me.I've always considered you to be the best airline - but this is just ridiculous."
490,Beautiful airline and great service I love it👌👌👌
491,Nikita G is a credit to your organization. Just came off a phone call with Emirates call center in Mumbai to find details about the current policy due to travel to India from UK. Nikita went above and beyond to assist me. Didn't think twice to make an effort to find the required information. Her professionalism and can-do attitude deserve appreciation. Thank you!
492,Being a part of emirates skyward loyalty was an amazing experience. Booking flights on emirates website was very easy and quick.
493,I have been attempting to get a fair refund from emirates for 5 months now. I have used their internal complaints system. Eventually received an offer for $178aud p.p. which  i rejected and made a complaint about asking how they came to this amount considering our itinerary originally had 4 flights at the cost of $1600aud each. We used 1 flight Brisbane to Dubai cost $650aud p.p. Emirates cancelled the other 3 flights. So why did a $650 pp fare now cost us $1422aud p.p.? Still awaiting a reply. Horrendous service. Flew with them frequently for many years. I don't think that I will ever use them again.
494,Awesome customer service from emirates. Due to covid I had to cancel a flight. Emirates service was great and refunded no problem.  They truly are my favourite airline with great customer service
495,"Beware of accepting Travel Vouchers if you need to cancel your flights. We had to cancel our plans back in March, and thought at the time we'd support Emirates by accepting a travel voucher for £1200 rather than a cash refund. When we came to use the voucher recently we found you couldn't use the voucher through their website booking service, you had to ring them instead. After 55 minutes on the phone, the flight was £60 more and the seats £24 more than was listed if we'd booked through their website. So in essence we've paid £84 extra for the privilege of using the travel voucher. Despite repeated phone calls and emails that this can't possibly be fair or just, their customer service which ranges from don't care to downright ignorance doesn't want to know. So we are now left with the choice of accepting we've been charged an additional £84 for having to use a travel voucher through their telephone service, or apply for 3 refunds, one for the remainder of the voucher credit, a second for the current flight and a third for the seat allocation costs. Oh, and wait 3 months to get it. Nice one Emirates, the combination of your grossly inept customer service to deal with what is blatant overcharging has left us extremely unhappy, and feeling nothing but contempt for your company."
496,"Booking ref: BND/19238912 Emirates Flight references: D5RCFJ I am extremely disappointed with the recent level of service as a business class customer from Emirates Holidays and the excessive wait times of over 12 minutes on +44 02089728948 without getting through.Further to my numerous e-mails, I have decided to cancel due the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Advice against international travel during the COVID 19 pandemic and would like a full refund. Travel against the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would invalidate my travel insurance. There is also a UK quarantine in place on returning travellers for 2 weeks which was not in place at the time of the booking. I have tried on several occasions to contact Emirates which has had excessive hold times in excess of 12 minutes resulting in me not getting through. There has also been no reply to my e-mails. I finally got a call from a Dubai based call centre who told me the flights and the hotels were already arranged and I would not be able to get a refund This is unacceptable as I am a regular customer and have booked business class tickets and a holiday for my family to celebrate my birthday."
497,AVOID AT ALL COST. In spite of 20 minutes argument with the airline manager 3 hrs before take off I was recorded as NO SHOW.This was my first encounter with these people. I rashed to book a flight because my mother was critical. There was nothing on their website  to indicate Emirate airlines required covid certificate. On reaching the check in three hours before take off with my passport and booking ready I was denied borading and was registered as (no show) because I had no covid certificate. This was totally unjustifiable and was a brazon lie. In spite of my argument (with the airline unhelpful manager) for 20 minutes I was recorded as NO SHOW. I was regarded as if I was not there and I missed the flight. This was basically theft and robbery to boost encome.
498,"Emirates abandoned me in Bangkok with two young babies, i am still waiting for my payment to cover the cost of replacement flights home after 5 months. dxb/x/au/280620/7661493"
499,"I was waiting for my refund since March 26th after the flight got cancelled. I have applied for refund April 2nd and Im waiting 4 months passed, still no refund. waiting... waiting..."
500,"BKK-LHR-BKK, First ClassI booked and paid for flights in March 2020 for departure in mid August 2020; twice they cancelled those “for operational reasons.” They did not rebook us. We needed to fly, so booked again for 02 September 2020. Then they announced they were “resuming flights” out of Bangkok from 01-Sep-20. Yet they cancelled the flight for 02-Sep they’d put us on. How can you trust a company that acts like this? It’s as if a shop puts something in the window and you go to the cashier and say “I’ll have that” and the cashier charges you and takes your money. Then you go to the delivery counter and they say “oh, the item is not available” without any apology. OK, so give me my money back straight away and I’ll try another shop, you say. “Oh no, sir, we can’t do that, you’ll have to wait at least 3 months before we can give you back what you just gave us.” This airline is a confidence trickster endulging in utterly fraudulent behaviour. Consumer Protection should be all over them. Qatar Airways are actually flying daily out of BKK btw and we got one of theirs."
501,"I requested refund more than 100 days ago. I have not received refund yet. Customer service keep promising it will be process soon, but not received any refund."
502,"Absolute trash customer service , they don't even know how to respond for an email . they have responded only one time with one of the most stupid emails i have seen in my entire life. Even a 5 years old would have written a better email. Also not responding for my email after that for more than 5 freaking months. Im losing it dealing with this airline.."
503,"137 days later....137 days later....This is a joint review for both Emirates and Opodo. Both companies are in my opinion as bar as each other and don't care about their customers once they have their money.Myself and my husband both key workers, myself and staff nurse for nhs and my husband a supermarket supervisor were in Australia in March when we received an email from Emirates to say our return flight was cancelled sorry for any inconvenience. This inconvenience being stuck on the other side of the world with not suggestion of them giving is any support to get back to the UK. No contact number given, no email address and not one email from opodo about this cancellation. Our flight was Emirates airline but booked through opodo. Which I will never do again.We then spent the next week on the phone to Emirates and opodo. To get through to anyone took hours. Sometimes 6+ hours, listening to the most irritating songs for this long certainly did no good for our mental well being.When we eventually got through to both companies we would the be told by emirates it had nothing to do with Emirates or be told by opodo it had nothing to do with them to contact Emirates instead. The frustration of this was awful. We couldn't get anyone anywhere to help us. We continued to get passed from pillar to post.By this point the British government had made an announcement that airlines were to allow passengers to transfer to other operating airlines for little to no fee. Again another day waiting for Emirates to answer their phone. Explained this to Emirates and how qatar were currently the only airline operating for us to get home. Emirates uselessly stated that they would allow us to transfer to any airline but for POLITICAL reasons would not allow us to transfer onto a qatar airline flight. This is absolutely ridiculous. They care no amount at all for their customers safety and well being. We were desperate to get home safely. And with every phone call and day passing we got more and more frustrated, upset and scared. Both opodo and emirates have proven to be absolutely useless and their customer service skills are terrible. Once they have your money they could not care less.We eventually managed to get a flight home which we had to pay full for.So on the 2nd April we phoned opodo again to start the refund process. At this stage we were informed by opodo that Emirates have stated 90 days will be the wait for any sort of refund. So then began the wait for 90 days.We are now at day 137. We have since contacted Emirates who say again it's upto opodo. We have also contacted opodo on a couple of occasions, one of which we were told within 3 days we would receive an update of our refund. I was reassured this would definitely happen. SHOCK. No update within 3 days. So another phone call. Yet no further forward as they say they can't do anything until they hear from Emirates.So currently myself and my husband and £1500 out of pocket as we had to get our own flight home organised. If it had been upto opodo and emirates we would still be stuck in Australia with no accommodation, no money and no wages.I would advise everyone to avoid both of these companies unless you want to be out of pocket and feel very unsafe on your holiday.I dread to think how much longer we have to wait for any sort of contact or refund. But 90 days is now 137 days so let's see.Absolutely useless terrible companiesEMIRATES and OPODO"
504,My card was used without my consent and then they have the nerve to send me a bill which shows several receipts with someone else’s signatures! Staff can not be trusted at this airline. Even the customer service lady ‘Sobha Nair’ kept repeating herself without looking at the big picture that I have not made these transactions nor are any of the signatures bearing any resemblance to my own. Avoid these scammers trying to extort people during Covid.
505,"I had five tickets booked which were cancelled (due to covid19) and eventually refunded after much hassle (as the booking was through a travel agent Emirates didn't care). My issue is with the 1000s of  expiring Skywards points which I've painstakingly accumulated. My request was simple that they granted an extension based on my paid booking. This request was made on multilpe occasions. I'm not comfortable flying right now hence looked at other spend options, which are very limited and expensive eg $35 for delivery of a Emirates t- shirt! Their final response was that as a goodwill gesture points expiring March to November 2020 would be extended until December 2020. So as little as one month! Emirates, your Skywards programme is trash and serves no benefit to customers.  Anyway you've lost a customer in me and to put this into context for you, I take 30 - 40 flights annually, be it business or leisure. Incidentally, it's not been possible to post on Emirates review page today (16 Aug 2020). I wonder why."
506,"Unbelievabley bad customer service, have been waiting since March for a refund of cancelled flights. filled in numerous refund requests , made many phone calls , only to receive a voucher which i did not request. Was given another tel number to ring to sort out that error . i have rung every day for 3 weeks and receive an automated message that all lines are busy ,please call back later. Then the line goes dead.Impossible to speak to them to get a resolution"
507,This company is a disgrace of aviation industry. They are stealing money from hard working people at the hight of pandemics. How is it even legal to cancel someones flight and refuse to refund the money without a fine. I will boycot this company and will never fly with them again. Shame on you for not supporting people who were your clients and using this to cash up instead.
508,"BND 19391326 RE the refund I am waiting for...This is a company is severe financial trouble, as it does not take 8 weeks or more to process a refund, it just takes the money being in their bank to actually refund people.I worked in the payments industry and I can tell you for a fact that refunding is either push button, by batch or completely automated.They are holding onto your money as they are waiting for others to book future holidays and flights to replenish their bank balance."
509,"My wife and I have been waiting on a refund since March due to our flights being cancelled, we have called Emirates on multiple occasions only to be passed back and forth between them and opodo! We were told in March that we would have to wait 90 days for our refund, it's now August. I've found the whole customer service experience with Emirates abysmal, I don't get the impression that they actually care about their customers and found them to be rude over the phone. I very rarely complain especially online but I can't stress enough how disappointed we are after hearing great things about Emirates."
510,I have received my full cash refund today after cancellation due to corona virus.Took 4 months but was given full cash refund.4 flights 3 passengers £1300.I booked through a travel agent Opodo with Emirates airline.Had to call 3 times and wait time was average but all sorted at end. Thankful
511,"Good day all I flew with Emirates on the 9th August flight EK762 from Johannesburg to Dubai. I had the unfortunate case of the lady problem and ran out of sanitary towels and the pharmacy were all closed at the airport, but a beautiful young Emirates employee went above and beyond for me Chane Gouws went threw so much effort and she help me tremendously by getting me some from with in Johannesburg before my flight took off, if it wasn't for her help I don't know what i would have done I am so greatful for her and wish her all the best Emirates is truly lucky to have a person of her kind nature working for them. Thank you again Chane Gouws for your help.♥️♥️"
512,"I requested refund since March 16th, I called many times and they said me I have to wait 3 months. July first I call back again and they say they don't find my refund request (what a joke all the previous cs found it and I have the email). Now they introduced a new refuind request this july first. I called 15 days after and said me 21 working days are the delays. I just called back today because still nothing and now they said me ""Sir it is 3 months and never 21 days"".... I will never fly again with that company. I was gold member, I will go to singapore airlines from now ! this company is a shame !"
513,"The public needs to use their brains and immediately needs to stop booking with Emirates. The UAE is very rich and can probably afford court battles, even if you took them to court. These scammers need to be boycotted, just stop booking with them, tell your family, friends and even post on Social Media. This is the way to HURT them like they HURT their customers.I still haven't received my refund and it's been 4 months, let's all feel sorry for a company who makes billions, but are struggling to give back £1100 :)Take action immediately, and stop booking with Emirates!"
514,"I was at Heathrow Airport today to catch Emirates EK0008 airline to fly to Dubai and from Dubai to Islamabad.Yesterday, I spoke to Emirates customer service to confirm my flight status and to find out if everything was okay, customer service agent took my contact details and email address and I was told everything was fine for me to travel, today I was surprised to know when I was told that I wasn't allowed to catch the plane as I didn't have covid19 test certificate.I was told that I need to have covid test done and contact again to check the availability, but later on when I rang, I was told there isn't any flight available till 27th of August.I was also advised to contact third party to get the new date, I rang the flightcatcher to find out my available options. I was told by the flightcatcher that they wouldn't be able to help me out as I bought the ticket online it was in their policy that all tickets booked through online with them are non changeable and non- refundable.I have asked them to keep my ticket open they said they can't do anything as it will be considered no show at airport.I have been dragged from pillar to post.I am still at Heathrow Airport waiting for my coach to come then I can go back to my home Birmingham.Such a shame I arrived here yesterday stayed in the hotel hoping to catch the plane today but it didn't happened."
515,"I've forwarded all the preceding reviews directly to four different email addresses for Emirates since I doubt they would bother themselves to read the reviews here. I have also had the same experience as earlier reviewers: I began this process in March and have still received no refund. At one point I received an email asking me for every detail of my bank account: no logo on the mail, badly expressed English, no signature, scrappy, unprofessional format. I suspected a scam, contacted Emirates by phone and was told unequivocally that it was a scam, and I should forward the mail to their own fraud detectors. I subsequently received an email contradicting their own representatives by stating it was not a scam and still asking me for an unacceptable list of bank details. A further email then asked me to begin the whole process again. I have emailed their so-called team leaders in Budapest who lack the common courtesy of replying.  This airline has been a model of utter incompetence, unprofessional communication and poor customer service. I have flown with this airline for over 15 years, but I shall not do so again."
516,"Most unreliable. Terrible, terrible customer service. Utterly unresponsive. Awful to staff, awful for customers. Just the worst ever! Too many complaints to list. One star is one star too many."
517,"Would give minus stars if I could. Me and my boyfriend travelled to Dubai on the 25th of July, we were aware of the Covid testing and was sent emails stating we needed negative tests before flying along with forms, which I rang emirates to confirm the one I had entering Dubai would be okay. On arrival to the airport on the 1st, checking in the bags they told me I could not fly, EVEN THOUGH I’d rang and confirmed it with someone on the phone, instead of helping us or explaining WHERE we can get Covid Tests, the company sent us to booking new flights where we were lead to believe it would be £200 to change. Pathetic. In our case we had to book a new hotel, pay £100 each for tests in a Dubai hospital (WHICH WE HAD IN THE AIRPORT AND LIED AND SAID THEY DIDNT) families and children were leaving the queue confused on what to do as not one person was clued up to help. Disgusting.At one point I was ignored by a supervisor, as he didn’t know what was going on either! Prior to this emirates also tried to stop my refund to Dubai for the 1st of June even though my sister was credited the full amount. Money grabbers to say the least.The company aught to be ashamed of themselves, fair enough they want to implement safe flying but there is no help for their customers who are paying them hundreds to fly and funding their jobs.Get your staff and customer service to ACTUALLY help people. Don’t even travel with them - you’ll end up being ignored."
518,"Since March 2020, i have been waiting for refund for Trip ID 200311714808 from cleartrip, no customer service from both Emirates (PNR IBPJCF) or cleartrip, i am getting automated replies, We have to get that to social media Channels And the news/press so these companies will know how we are suffering, i had a call with emirates, the customer service representative Said get off the line and talk to ur agency cleartrip, he made me wait on dead line waiting for the survey. No quality"
519,"I submitted a refund request on 13th March 2020 and was told that they would refund my ticket in 3 weeks. 5+ weeks later, no refund yet and I called them again and they told me I needed to submit additional refund request due to Covid. I submitted again on 24th April and waited for several weeks. 21st July, received an email saying the refund is in process yet I haven't received the refund as of today 30th July 2020. Great Job Emirates, way to lose a customer."
520,Emirates is a scam. Requested for a refund in April and nothing up to now!!#Pay back the money
521,"I booked 3 flights Newcastle to Bangkok late 2019 to fly August 2020. My travel agent went bust in March but my tickets issued, so Emirates have my money. Then they emailed to tell me they changed the Dubai to Bangkok part of the flight times. What they never told me was they cancelled the Newcastle to Dubai flight. When I rang they kept telling me to contact my travel agent and refused to accept they had gone bust. Even though its all over the net, it wasn't on their system apparently. I asked them to email me that the flight was cancelled, but they refused again telling me to contact my travel agent, which I cant. They tell me I can have an open ticket to fly another time but that time expires next year as I booked so long ago. Currently trying to claim the £1900 owed back off visa with no help at all from Emirates."
522,Emirates have been really fair with co-vid situation and issued me a travel voucher for September booked flights to India & Nepal. Was processed promptly & their customer services guy was great on the phone. I’d have given 5* but for issues completing their online forms which necessitated further calls.
523,"I am one of those passengers whose flight was cancelled due to Covid and stranded abroad. In April, I filled in the form for refund and now it is almost the end of July I heard from Emirates -despite my countless attempts to hear from both Dubai and Istanbul until their inefficient Istanbul bureau finally closed down, not even receiving phone calls and replying emails with a single sentence 'automatic' replies- and when I heard from them it was only to announce they are paying only the half of my ticket price. (Even they haven't paid it yet.)Following, I filled in a complaint form asking for the reason behind that cut/deduction and received the explanation that it is due to ""unutilized base fare and unused tax"". Thus I contacted them on live chat this time and conveyed that explanation is illogical as I could have 'utilize' and 'use' them if the company hadn't cancelled my flight (I know that was by the government's decision yet after all I was not the one who cancelled it so why I was the one suffering in such a case only; they could deduce maybe 1/4 of the price but why half) and received the reply from their imaginative officer Ms Priyanka that even if it had been operating how I could dare to fly in Covid atmosphere which was none of her business. (I guess she could only think we wanted to fly for joy, being stranded in someone else's country, in hotel rooms must be beyond her imagination power.) Then I asked her the law/regulation that gives the right to the company to go for such deduction on the website but she was totally unaware that a company is also bound with certain laws to the customers which they have to share it on their websites, so cannot act as it wishes. All in all, flying with Emirates was a life time experience in negative sense on my side and I will ever never fly with them even if it would be the only airline flying to my destination. No quality with the officers, arrogant attitude of domestic bureau workers (Istanbul), calculative and greedy and almost unlawful (as they still haven't showed/provided me with the law that gives them the right to go for such deductions-it is ""I decided so and did so"" mentality which leaves no sense of security in one as a customer) approach of the company...Sorry but you cannot alter your prestige by sponsoring sport events and giving profound advertisements. The thing that bestows a firm a good image, prestige is their work policy. Emirates prefered loss of customers to loss of money. With Emirates, never again..."
524,"I had a flight booked from Auckland to Gatwick London via Dubai. 3 weeks before my flight Emirates cancelled my flight due to ""Operational"" reasons. Then I did some homework as I have a friend who works for flight centre. I found out the airline was still flying but was only booking first and business class, flying the exact same route...so they kicked me from my flight and bumped up the prices to capitalize...I went onto sky scanner and their Emirates home page just to verify I could book and it was possible for a pricey fee.. I later phones Emirates to find out why they canceled. Emirates customer service blatantly lie to me saying they aren't flying any flights during those dates from Auckland. This will be the last time I ever fly Emirates!! The fact that they can lie to you and think they can get away with it. Terrible customer service and full of lies!! I will endevour to tell as many people as possible. You have lost a good customer!"
525,"Yes requesting refund mid-march, received refund request confirmation email yet Emirates deny receiving it and have asked me to resubmit, apparently being escalated but feels like they’re just delaying."
526,Flight cancelled in April still no refund. Travel agent say emirates delaying refund. Booking id: OE7795Happy with Emirates in the past but even though frequent flyer member have been unable to contact them.
527,"Probably Emirates is the most disgraceful airline of the world. I have travelled with them twice and have decided not to use this airline again due to their unprossional attitude, arrogance and the worst customer services they provide. I had to catch a transit flight from Dubai Airport to Karachi Internatinal  on both occassions. Staff at Dubai Airport are impolite, harsh , arrogant and very unhelpful. You feel like surrounded by thugs and gangsters. They don't answer your querries in a friendly polite way and speak in a disgraceful , uncivilised style. Extremely stubborn and arrogant people with ill-mannered and discourteous attitude towards passengers. Never use this Airline."
528,"I had a flight with Emirate. It was comfortable and on time but during the transfer in Dubai airport my luggage totally smashed. The customer service in Dusseldorf airport mentioned that there should not be any problem and Emirate compensate it. However, after 22 calls to Emirate, I could not able to even see their consideration. On each call someone from Dubai answers the phone and mention that they will call back you withing 2 hours and follow up the case but nothing happens. I gave up the case and never use Emirate again."
529,"Cancelled my flight in March and still did not receive the refund.Calling their call center is useless, they do not provide any information about the status and they refuse to provide any written information so you cannot open a case against them. I urge to authorities to take action on this situation as they are getting interest from all the money they are not refunding"
530,Have flown with them a number of times and have to give them credit for consistently providing good service. Enjoyed most flights and would always look to use them as first choice. There are hiccups and they were resolved
531,"One star is pushing it if I am to be candid, emotions aside, I am exhausted from chasing my refund and recounting what I went through before I had to cancel my flight. Heartless, lying and disorganised staff. after the most horrible experience ever in my life! Emirates please, please pay me back my £680!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will cancel my holiday if this airline was the only one available again. Never ever again. they don’t deserve customers. Extremely unprofessional."
532,"I used to be a fan of this company, but their abhorrent customer service has changed that and will never fly with them again. Ticket got ""cancelled"" and I spoke with them and was promised a full refund within 2 weeks. That was over a month ago and when I ask them now where my refund is they said it would take 90 days. It's an automatic process for a flight that they know is cancelled so it shouldn't take longer than usual. They just want to keep your money in their accounts a little longer, letting the passengers fund their losses during this pandemic. Hurry up and feel sorry for this 104 billion dollar company who's clearly taking advantage of it's customers to make more money. Now I have to pay interest on the ticket price through a credit card for 3 months while they earn interest on that money for 3 months. Scammers."
533,Emirates cancelled our flights twice yet for some strange reason the flight will still go ahead if I upgrade to business class? Disgrace of a company will not be using again
534,DISGRACEFUL COMPANY. REFUND YOUR CUSTOMERS. EMIRATES ARE THE MOST HATED AIRLINE IN THE WORLD.
535,"Shoutout to Denise at Emirates, Glasgow International Airport. An elderly lady was trying to catch a flight from Glasgow, but it so happened that her connections and Dubai's Covid regulations didn't work out for that particular flight. Denise at the check-in counter handled the situation with utmost empathy for the lady and her situation. She really took it upon herself to find a solution for the lady, and was extremely proactive in figuring out solutions, and putting herself in the lady's shoes to understand her concerns. I don't think I've seen such amazing customer service (or just anyone being such an amazing human being) in my life. The whole situation left a great impression, and I will definitely choose to fly Emirates again."
536,"My flight was in Febrauary from Birmingham to Delhi and return June from Mumbai to Birmingham. My flight got cancelled due to Covid-19. I was told that I need to come to Dubai to go to Birmingham. Considering no domestic flights operational in India and no flights to Dubai. No communications from Emirates and Southhall Travels ,who booked the ticket. I had two more flights cancelled , no received any refunds. They are all ready to book tickets,but will not talk about refunds. I had terrible time to sort money out with bank.They don't care !  As long as they get money for bookings.I say boycott Airline and pick other form of Airline, which will respect customers ."
537,This diabolical Airline avoid answering any questions regarding your lawful refunds  .They refuse to return monies owed and actually lie in emails to string you along .Only use them if you are prepared for huge amounts stress when they let you down with your flights .Terrible underhand company .Never again !
538,"After purchasing a £400 flight to take me home during covid-19 the flights were cancelled and the service has been appalling. Information from the airline was unprofessional with just a notice put up in the airport with no staff to answer questions from paying passengers as all flights were cancelled from 25th March. My flight was the 27th March so I had to pay for additional flights costing more than £1000 to get me home. After hours of waiting in the airport one man from emirates came out and just shouted at hundreds of people waiting that he cannot help, Emirates won’t be flying and to leave the area. No help, no guidance and no respect for paying customers! I went online immediately to get a refund as I needed the money desperately and 3 and a half months later I still have no refund. The communication has been poor throughout. I asked for updates and was told the middle of June I would be fully refunded, then I was told the end of June, then told the middle of July. I have been left with a huge financial burden in these stressful times as I am now unemployed and as a loyal paying customer the service from Emirates is disgraceful. Why does it take over 3 months to issue a refund?!"
539,Left us stranded in NZ. No care. No assistance. Just a text telling us our flight was cancelled. Unhelpful ever since. Still no refund (although that could be the agent) 4 months on.
540,"Emirates is an Airline with good reputation, but I was extremely disappointed how it handled things around the Corona virus:Had no checks carried out either at the airports on before the flight, not even a temperature check. On the airport and on the flight as well I've seen visibly sick people, people who were coughing really badly. After travelling I got sick and I'm confident I got it during my flight.When I was flying out to Australia countries have started to introduced lockdown measures so I have decided to move my return flight forward (to make sure I don't stuck on the other side of the world).Whilst Emirates guaranteed ticket flexibility to people who were travelling during this period (they let you change the travel time) I was disgusted by the fact that if you change your return flight Emirates will charge you for a one way ticket which is double the price of a return ticket. So instead of you only paying for the difference between your new ticket and the old ticket you also have to pay for the difference between a single trip and round trip which is absolutely ridiculous and I don't think it's at all acceptable.The Emirates website was saying that all tickets are sold out for they flight I've chosen and on other flight I would have had to pay even more so I bought a ticket from Quantas (which turned out to be on an Emirates flight)I've submitted a cancellation request on my original Emirates flight on 20th March and still hasn't received any response.I could't be more disappointed with Emirates, especially that I never got my unused ticket refunded. Due to this bad experience I wouldn't use Emirates again and would talk anyone out of using them."
541,"Useless staff and 1 star is too much for them. This is what happened;I booked my ticket from Dubai to Toronto on Emirates airlines through a website called Opodo. Due to the changes in regulations about residents coming back to UAE, I had to cancel my booking. I called Emirates airlines to cancel and the agent who answered said that the ticket is booked through an agency and I have to contact them for any modifications. I contacted the agency and requested a cancelation, received an email that my request has been initiated and prioritized. I called the Emirates airlines to make sure that they have received a cancelation request, but the agent who answered said that my ticked in locked since it is booked from an agency and if they said that it is canceled then I should be fine. I tried to call the agency in the UK again to make sure everything has been processed and what are my options for a refund. Couldn't get a hold of anyone. On my departure day, I called Emirates airlines again to check if the flight is canceled. The agent said that they didn't receive any cancellation requests from the agency but she will cancel it so I won't be charged the no-show fees but regarding refunds I have to contact the agency since Emirates doesn't interfere with that. I called the agency in the UK again and the agent on the phone said that I will get a refund of 4030 AED while I paid 6114 AED. She couldn't explain the breakdown of the charges and told me that it is a mix of cancelation fees and no-show fees. I told her that the flight is at 9 on July 3rd and I requested a cancelation on July 1st and then I called the airlines at 6:43 on July 3rd. She said she will contact Emirates and get back to me. I called Emirates again, asked to speak to a manager and the agent won't transfer my call to any of the managers there. I explained to her what happened and she said there is no no-show fees and I should ask the agency to contact Emirates. I called the Opodo agent while the Emirates agent is on the call and asked about the refund. The Emirates agent said that there is no a no-show fee. The Opodo agent said that the woman before who answered the call was confused but now my refund will be 4500 AED. I asked him if he gives me a breakdown of what he is charging me, he said 700AED cancelation fees, 670AED non-refundable taxes and 200 service fees. The agent from Emirates online was on the phone and I asked her if this is how they make their calculations, she said we don't interfere with refunds. I asked the Opodo agent to proceed with the refund and send me a breakdown of the charges since I am taking this further. Emirates airlines didn't take any ownership for me as a passenger, they basically pass people on for some agencies to rip them off. There is no such a thing of service charge as there are cancelation fees, the non-refundable taxes are only 120AED not 670AED. The agent sat there listening to all the incorrect information given to me and said nothing."
542,"What a rubbish Company this is turning out to be, like hundreds of others we have flown thousands of miles with Emirates, all over the world.  We will not fly with them again.We have a holiday booked with Emirates Holidays in September 2020  for obvious reasons we do not now wish to go as it will not be the experience we have booked, ie flight will be rubbish with no food, duty free, drinks etc and having to wear a mask and request the toilet is not something we wish to pay for.  Likewise the hotel will not be what we want with no buffet and no doubt limited use of pools and sun beds.  But will they give us our money back?  NO, they have said our holiday will be available, regardless of the fact that it will not be what we paid for.Emirates, you have lost loyal, faithful customers because of your lack of empathy and reading these reviews we are not the only ones to say this and will not be the last to leave and forsake you.We genuinely believed and know from experience you  WERE one of the best airlines in the world BUT NOT NOW.Just for the record P & O were great and gave us a refund, so guess who will will book with again."
543,"I had booked tickets through the emirates online site in february as i was meant to play in a tournanament in australia in november, but unfortunately this was cancelled due to covidI explained this to emirates in an email on may 8th.I have recieved a full refund within 7 weeks.So although i see a lot of negatives on here, the way my situation has been dealt with has been brilliant.So i think patience is key in these unprecedented times."
544,"Worst experience ever! Went to Malaysia and had to return after two days of arrival due to COVID-19 outbreak. We should’ve been able to use the return ticket but the website didn’t allow it, and couldn’t reach the customer service either. We had to book a new expensive ticket to go back and applied for a refund afterward. Two months later we get to know that we’re not going to get any refund on the new tickets although it was a fault on their systems and website/app. Horrible experience and they obviously don’t care about their customers."
545,"The website is like the magic roundabout, back to the same page time after time.I need to cancel a booking due to covid situation, it asks for information that simply isn't available & stalls.So back to the same page, again & again.So much for you can manage all aspects of your booking online, you simply cannot."
546,"Wish I could vote minus 10. Emirates cancelled our daughter’s flight at the last minute, leaving her stranded in Bali. No refund or alternative flight arrangements offered. Unable to contact them in any way. We had to pay for a ticket with another airline at a considerably higher cost. Can we claim a refund? Yes if we pay a cancellation fee that is almost the cost of the flight! A cancellation fee that WE ARE EXPECTED TO PAY WHEN EMIRATES CANCELLED, NOT US!!!  Claimed a chargeback via the credit card we paid on and guess what? Emirates have disputed it. What a bunch of dishonest thieves?  When the world is back to what we once considered “normal” customers will remember how they have been treated by companies looking to rip them off at this time. Beware Emirates."
547,"First class plane third class customer service.I called and enquire about the fare $850,so reasonable after 5 days I try to make reservation was shocked when they told me $1325.I asked why the fare goes that much higher now, I was told  every day fare change.I got the ticket from my travel agency much cheaper .I was little existed first time fly in airbus 380,a huge plane.I was expecting  best customer service but very disappointed to see terrible customer service.I was in economy class.They were serving dinner,I was very tired can't eat this time request the air hostess I want to eat later.After an hour ago I felt hungry and call for the food,the air hostess came look very mean and mad,I asked her for some food,the answer was why didn't eat when food was serving we can't serve at this time.I felt very insulting.I am an old guy and on madician become very frustrated,A big air line I am flying and that kind of cheep talking.I felt like or dislike by these air hostess. I don't want to fly with emirates again."
548,"Booked to fly 1 April. Trip of a lifetime to New Zealand to see family. Obviously Covid had other ideas. Not going on the trip was disappointing enough but I honestly expected better of Emirates. Fobbed off at every turn. The most frequent mantra “Don’t worry, your refund has been approved. I’ll escalate your claim.”It’s been three months and still no sign of a refund.Finding it difficult to believe some of the 5 star reviews on here."
549,"The customer service is really bad. As an ex-silver card member, I travelled a lot in between UK and Aisa via many different airliners. The reason why I give up Emirates is due to its service either online and on board. They are lack of training and the most disappointed thing is that they have very dodgy fare rule which makes refund almost impossible. If I can pay 2000 pounds or 3000 USD for business class, I will never choose Emirates for sure."
550,"Is ""Emirates"" in a ""free fall""?We are a little shaken ...Have flown many times with Emirates - And we have always been deeply impressed with the standard of the planes, The flights, onboard service .. And not least the professionalism you experienced when booking - and check-in and general information.But what we are experiencing right now is ""the wild west"".We booked in January a trip home from New Zealand to CPH on June 22. But suddenly - Back in april - It disappeared from the Emirates management page.(The site where you manage your orders yourself)No emails or messages - It just wasn't there anymore ...After several days of trying, we finally managed to get in touch with ""Emirates"" who could simply tell that the plane was likely to be canceled.About a month ago, there was a friendly employee - who, for an additional fee, rebooked for new flights July 3rd, 2020.But Sunday (Yesterday 22. of june) We had the same experience again.When we had to ""check in"" with airplane seat and dining etc.One of the planes had ""disappeared"".Now more than 24 hours have passed - And we still haven't heard from ""Emirates"".(In another website we have found out that Emirates have dropped - as the only airline - to fly from Australia to Dubai throughout July ... Apparently)However, we have received a standard message - That they can offer us a voucher - If we choose to go home with another airline !!(Which we are then forced to try ...)We understand that these are special times.But it is precisely in ""headwinds"" that you have to prove yourself worthy of the responsibility and respect.And we have NOT experienced that - at all."
551,"No refund even after death in family.  On 6th March, I cancelled my trip from the UK to Asia due to a close family member passing away.  Completed online and death certificate attached.  It is nearly July and still no refund.  Multiple calls to ""customer service"" are met with bad-tempered phone operators who can provide no information (or incorrect information) and who can simply ""send an email to the appropriate team"".   No progress, outlook or escalation is available.   I suspect that legal action may be the only way to recover the money, as Emirates are clearly hoping that people will give up and go away."
552,Emirates are really terrible in the way they have dealt with refunds I’m still waiting over 3 months I have submitted all forms they requested but still zero get the same messages thanks for your patience and understanding well that’s a no if you have cancelled my flights which you did then give me my money back why can it be fair that people who booked after March some have been refunded yet I’m still waiting used Emirates a lot in the past with no issues but obviously can’t manage a crisis yet some low class airlines have been amazing to customers so do us all a favour GIVE US OUR Refund
553,The experience I had with emirates is bad the crew lie about unoccupied seat that economy passengers don’t take them in the long flight as they say the seats are for crew which they never use them till end of flight as they have deferent areas in A380 plans to take rest. In other hand because of virus they cancelled flight and caused lots of inconvenience for passengers without any compensation even not a kilo luggage allowance.
554,There’s was ne thinking Emirates are amazing... never again! Poor customer service... keep referring back to travel agent even though they have my money and I have a boarding pass with them. All I wanted was a travel voucher and they won’t give one or my money...... won’t speak to me.. will get the credit card company to sort it now! DONT  FLY WITH THEM!
555,"Booked via OnTheBeach my trip was cancelled at the end of March 20 for mid April and still not received my money back. OnTheBeach claim Emirates haven’t issued my refund Emirates claim they have issued my refund. Both lying, yet I’m still the one out of pocket."
556,"In these times, I know it is difficult for these companies. I know it took 6 weeks for them to process the refund, but I filled in the form online and I got a full refund.Thanks Emirates for service...people just need a little patience in these unprecedented times."
557,"Only positive thing is, that Emirates are good selling ticketsIt's now 92 days (corrected 134 days) since I asked for a refund of one of those tickets, due to their cancellation.I got an confirmation, but except for that, I heard NOTHING.I called the callcenter a couple of times, they couldn't care less.Their Facebook messenger is a really bad joke of a robot.The service from Emirates until now, have been non-existing."
558,I purchased a ticket with 0 refund fee But after 15 days i cancel the ticket before 6 days of my flightThey took 15 days to refund + they charge me 120usd for 589 usd ticketWhen i was buying ticket they said 0 refund fee and 0 cancel fee
559,"When it comes to refunds, Emirates are not even a third-rate airline. I have been in touch with them on the phone at least 6 times over the past 3 months and still no refund from a cancelled flight which I was due to take on the 19th March. I applied for the refund on the 16th March and exactly 3 months later, despite all the false promises, I have received precisely nothing. The only saving grace is I have plenty of options when it comes to who I fly with in the future so I can safely say that I am done with Emirates (as are all my colleagues on my strict recommendation). Let's hope the Dubai govt have plenty of cash to bail them out as I am pretty sure there are hundreds of people in the same position as me.Extremely disappointing"
560,I requested my refund for flights cancelled by emirates on 24th March 2020 - flight date was also 24th March - I had less than 12 hours notice of the cancellation and only found out it was cancelled when I attempted to check in on line. I never received any direct notification of the cancelled flight which was booked directly with emirates.It is now 16th June 2020 and still no notification of when I will get my refund.Their customer service is appalling !
561,I received Email from Emirates airline that I will be fully  refunded 1 month ago and still I haven't received any thing. Maybe they changed their mind and they will not refund anything. Totally unprofessional. I will never fly with you even if you are the only airline working in the universe. Shame on you.
562,Always first class service- never a complaint
563,"Do not book tickets with Emirates via a travel agency. I booked my tickets via Gotogate. Emirates and Gotogate have changed my flights a number of times and they have done so without consulting with me. Gotogate are not willing to cancel or rebook my flight, and Emirates are not willing to help in any way as they say the matter is out of their hands.Why would Emirates associate themselves with such a terrible company?Extremely poor customer service"
564,Beyond a joke expecting customers to wait a year to get their money back. I rung them was polite and explained the UK law and that they have to refund. The man on the phone was so rude and told me I wasn’t getting a refund at all. He never even took any of my details so it baffled me how he could tell me that. Now I’ve seen they’ve said no refund for a year. See you in court Emirates!!!!
565,"UPDATED 04-09-2020So after paying over £1000 for new flights after Emirates canceled mine to fly back from Adelaide it has taken Emirates 6 months to give me WAIT FOR IT !!!!We are pleased to advise that your refund request has been processed by Emirates. The total refund amount due to you is GBP194.42.An amount of GBP194.42 will be refunded to your Credit Card.Had the cheek to inform me that because i paid for new flights they calculate the flights (They canceled) to be less than 3rd of the total cost of the originalDisgraceful attitude watch out for months of social media from me on all sites the value of my flight !!! How is it possible then that I was charged over £1000 when I booked my new flight . This isn't the last time they will hear from me  29-06-2020Still no Communication from Emirates........... Shocking Customer serviceDuring Covid-19The issue that we have experienced was: After pre-empting the cancellation of flights from Adelaide i purchased NEW flights to come home early only to discover Emirates took payment and then at checkin informed me that their system had cancelled the flights as it Assumed they were duplicates even though they had in fact already canceled our original Adelaide flights 24hrs AFTER i had booked new tickets. I spent 2 hours desperately trying to get on the flight i had already paid for to be told it would cost me a further £900 per person. We were forced to standby until the boarding was closed and then forced to accept seats on a different aisle from my wife so we could get home. The flight had to my visual knowledge 2 rows with empty adjioning seats and one row of 3 completly empty seats. Emirates now hold funds for flights i did not take. NOTE I have video footage of this debarcale taking place at the Help Desk at Adelaide airport with Emirates staff telling me they would call security if i did not stop videoing .The staff member wanted to charge me £900 on top of my original payment before i could get a flight .It occurred on: 21/03/2020This meant that I have experienced the worst customer service of ANY company i have ever dealt with. I have failed miserably to contact Emirates by phone, facebook and online whilst in Australia and now whilst back in the UK. I have spoken to Dubai on numerous occasions each time being supplied contact numbers that do not connectI expect a full cash refund and compensation for way they took my funds and the trauma suffered by my wife and myself at their hands at such a worrying time."
566,"Like many others I have struggled to receive a refund for flights I bought which were cancelled by Emirates due to Covid-19. I have had to submit my refund request three times, only to have them tell me I had to complete a separate form to have my seat selection refunded - why!?! Still no refund after two months, and they cannot tell me when to expect this.  Every other travel company I've dealt with to request a refund (AirBnB, Easyjet, BA) have processed the regund promptly and fairly.  Emirates - your customers won't forget how poorly you have behaved during this period.  Shame on you."
567,"Booked our flights through Emirates for our honeymoon this year. Unfortunately, our wedding and honeymoon was cancelled due to Covid-19. However, emirates issued a direct refund in less than 30-days which is amazing under the current circumstances and how many refunds they have to process.We have called a few times to times for this to be chased within the 30-day waiting period and they were always helpful and reassuring. We received an email of confirmation that the refund had been processed and the money was in our account 2 days later.I Will definitely fly with them in the future and my advice to anyone else waiting is to be kind and patient with the team."
568,"Would just like to share that I have finally received my refund after waiting for 10 weeks. I'm only giving the company 2 stars though because their customer agents needs better training. One told me, I will get my refund in 15 days. The other told my 30 days and then 12 months and then 3 months."
569,"The airline couldn't care less about leaving it's passengers stranded. Shame on themI was in India with friends in March 2020 and about 2-3 days before our flight was to leave Delhi, we received an email from Emirates saying that our flights had been cancelled, nothing more nothing less. They didnt give us other options or information. Their phones werent working and when you did manage to connect with them they said they couldn't do anything. Luckily our travel agent managed to book us a flight back.Soon after we left, India went on full lockdown. We almost got stuck there. And the feeling of the experience was complete neglect and lack of empathy from this greedy airline.I flew with them another time some years ago, and since then I can affirm that this airline has lost its quality...The experience has made one thing clear, I will no longer travel with them in the future."
570,"Absolutely disgusting behaviour by the airline company, my flight was cancelled due to covid19, and only option at the time was a voucher which I took2 weeks later Emirates put on their actual website that they have now updated their refund policy and were happy to give the money back instead of the voucher On the 01/05/20 I called Emirates and they upheld the refund, cancelling the voucher and advised the money would be back with me witching 3 months, that was no problem On the 01/06/2020 they contacted me to tell me that no refund was being issued and that the voucher was still being upheld, when I explained to them that it states this on their own website and all the international media that the new policy was in place, the call handler replied oh that’s just “fake” news, how embarrassing Complete liars"
571,"We booked with Emirates because we thought it was one of the best airlines and have used it a number of times. After our flight was cancelled due to coronavirus we applied for a refund . 3 moths later having applied 3 more times they still have not had the decency to reply beyond the standard email. £2800 of our money is sitting in their bank, it’s disgraceful."
572,"Booked a flight, they cancelled it, but will not refund."
573,"After 7 weeks, filling a EU complaint under air passenger rights, a retail dispute case with debit card provider, I finally got my money back. My message to anyone reading this, is chase Emirates. In their Terms and Conditions on their website, they state, 'We will refund any ticket, where we have cancelled the flight'. We booked Emirates to travel to Japan not because of cost (they were expensive), but because they have a reputation of being the best. I fast fear that this reputation has now been dramatically reduced. Easy Jet were far quicker to respond to me when they cancelled my flight offering a full refund. I actually have an email from Emirates, where they are refusing to offer me any type of refund, despite repeated polite requests and declining their offer of vouchers. Prior to this I had two airlines that I would not travel on, 'FlyBe' and 'RyanAir'. I would say that this list has now increased to three with the addition of 'Emirates', however 'FlyBe' are no more. If you are reading this post before booking with Emirates, just be aware that they have a long history of slow refunds after cancelling flights. There are alternatives out there and I will certainly not forget this experience. Emirates, you have lost my custom for ever."
574,"would have given a minus score iff poss,So your Email says It's time to reconnect with the world, Why on Earth do you think would want to fly again with an airline that cancels your flight with NO notice that leaves you stranded 10000 miles from home and doesn't even have the decency to send you an Email to say it has been cancelled, An airline that doesn't reply to Emails or answer the phone, This is one Airline that doesn't care one bit about it's customers once it has your money, We had a contract we paid you to take us to Australia and return us back to the UK, YOU FAILED in all respects dramatically, you failed in your duty of care dramatically, you left us to find our own way back, As a consequence we are £1600 out of pocket due to your negligence, You should have at least bought back the your customers  who travelled out with you and to add further insult myself and and a lot of your other customers have had no signs of any refund, you have chosen to ignore that as well,I WILL NEVER EVER FLY WITH EMIRATES AGAIN and i am not the only one from what i have seen in these reviews, You think you can just restart again and pick up from where you left off, Think again there are a lot of angry EX customers out there, It takes years to build up customer following and trust and you have destroyed that overnight it is going to take years to get that back, If ever, Wouldn't surprise me if some sort of group court action isn't taken against you for your failure to pay refunds owing, If you are still thinking of using this Airline in the future after reading this you must be mad!"
575,"I'd give them zero if possible!! - Tried to steal my money after cancelling my flight! Offered a rubbish voucher, refused to refund, even though they are breaking the law doing this!! I had to use chargeback to get my money, now they are disputing it!! - I will never ever use Emirates!!!"
576,"I order my ticket BKK-Dubai-Oslo. the flight was canceled due to the coronacrisis. 2 days later I get an email from Emirates to request for a refund.After I send my request, I again get an email confirming that they received my request and would get an answer within 4 weeks.4 weeks later I get a new email, confirming that the amount was send to my acoount, which was correct. Very good customerservice from a very good and company. I point out this was an economyticket.To get back I had to buy 5 tickets from 4 different airliners, before I at last get back, only Emirates treated me very well, the other airliners I am still waiting an answer after 2 months."
577,I applied for a refund 8 weeks ago. I have called and submitted a complaint but still no response. I have always flown with Emirates but will no longer use them. Still no refund of nearly £1000
578,"Still awaiting refund fro flight cancel on the 25 th March, rubbish airline, will never use them again."
579,"I want to say a big thank you to the Emirates customer resolution team and in particular to Melissa Kiely who processed my query to reschedule my travel plans to Dubai in such an efficient, patient and charming manner.My concern over been able to change my travel plans were quickly resolved and in a very timely manner considering the unprecedented times that Emirates and their customers are facing. I can now look forward to my first ever trip to Dubai when the time is right to travel again.Thank you Emirates"
580,Worst customer service experience. if your flight is cancelled you have to send a request using their refund form again and again and again. And you know what according to agent beverly you have to request many times so that you will be refunded. I submitted the request form last march. According to her i have to submit again. The reason i post this because i have two bookings. I submitted both request last march. But then i did not receive any confirmation. So i requested another refund for only one of my booking just to check if there is any changes. And yes just today 18 may 2020. I received an email that i will have my money back. But since i did not submit another request for my other booking it was not processed. According to the agent i have to request it again. I am so 😤. So those who did not receive any email confirmation submit a Request Refund as many as you can.
581,"I can honestly say that I have received nothing but exceptional service from Emirates, having had my holiday to Thailand cancelled due to Covid.I contacted them by phone on the 15/4 and was answered very promptly. It was my first attempt too. Within minutes my full cash refund was authorised and email confirmation received. The refund would take up to 8 weeks to come through which I felt was very reasonable due to the chaos they would be experiencing. Indeed, the refund came through on the 11th May....incredibly fast.My compliments to Vladimir, who handled my initial call and follow up email and a lady in the call centre (name unknown due to my hearing).Credit where credit is due as I know only too well that most people are only too happy to put pen to paper to complain but rarely feel it necessary when they have received excellent service.Thank you Emirates"
582,"Where do you start when there is so much to complain about? Yes there was Covid -19 but when the cancel your flight home but continue to fly for a further 5 days post the notification and with no offer to repatriate early I think is shocking! Then there's the consequential losses incurred finding an alternative flight back to the Uk. Emirates don't believe they have a responsibility to cover any consequential losses using the excuse of a complete lockdown however they didn't lock down and have also continued to fly on selected flights that they choose to host!So are Emirates a great airline - No in fact they're just as bad as the cheap airlines, if not worse because you're paying more!I even contacted Sir Tim himself (CEO) and requested he got involved, but within minutes the usual poor customer service response was issued.So where does that leave me? Well I'm currently 2.7k out of pocket and that doesn't include the flight they cancelled (which I've had no refund either), so I'm left with no choice but to file with the small claims courts and claim against Sir Tim himself as the CEO.......so watch this space."
583,"another frustrated customer, however i have had a refund today May 8 (thankyou Emirates) but refund based on todays exchange rate and not in March when i bought ticket , so am £38 worse off, so why havent they refunded same amount they took out of my account in March. I was left stranded at Saigon airport(toLondon) for a 11,55 pm flight 24 March.. and they  announced flights would be cancelled on that day starting from 25 March. so hoped my flight on 24th just 5 mins would go.BUT NO. Like others i have read, i had to apply twice using online refund claim form , plus a complaint form that was never replied to. wish me luck in endeavours to get refund which should be exact amount i gave them! not exchange rate.."
584,On the day Emirates has announced 1.9 billion in profits — they still have not refunded my flight DBX to BHX return ticket. I applied for refund 5th March 2020. So far they made me reapply twice for refund (even though I correctly filled in the refund request form the first time). I phone today to check progress; they didn’t recognise my E-ticket number? Even though I still have the original email of my e-ticket sent at the time of my original booking. They’ve had my money since I booked 21st January 2020. Ridiculous amount of time to wait for my refund which I’m fully entitled to. Rang again - was given an email address to write to for customer care which was an incorrect email address. Rang again - they said my refund was processed months ago - I haven’t received any money back on my credit card. Rang again... refund hasn’t been processed. Still can’t find my e-ticket number on their system. Gave them booking reference- now they can find it. They are not sure of the refund status. They said they will email refund department to chase it. Now we know how they make their billions of profits. By denying hardworking and loyal customers their refunds. Will never fly Emirates again! Steer well clear!
585,Horrible and immoral company to not be transparant in refunding tickets. I trusted them and after buying the most (expensive) flexible business class tickets with full refund promise they simply do not refund. This will hit them hard in future. I do not trust them anymore to book travel with them.
586,Absolutely disgusted. Unethical business practices. Somebody needs to hold them accountable
587,"I struggle to understand the many negative reviews.  Were all airlines like that! 👍🏼 For me, the top !!"
588,"Massive thank you to the Emirates customer service team who have allowed us to cancel our honeymoon for July,  even though it’s not technically canceled yet and have issued us a refund voucher so we can re book for next year as we have had to postpone the wedding. They have been a big help and so flexible during this difficult time."
589,"Still waiting on our refund. Been 2 months, not acceptable was a fully refundable thicket and they deducted $600. Was suppose to take 21 days. Can take your money electronically in one day and 21 to refund. What a joke. This is a company strategy uto hold on to cash to pay their own bills. You will never get away with this in future. All funds should be held in trust until the service is provided."
590,"We had a business class flight from Auckland, New Zealand to Wien, Austria booked for April 20. Obviously Corona crisis happened and we all know the story how almost all flights including this one was cancelled. The terms of the ticket clearly stated that they will refund full amount if they cancel the flight. As other reviewers had mentioned as well, they have since changed their terms so that all refunds are subject to cancellation terms regardless of if they cancel or the client cancels. Thus they are refusing to refund and try to offer their vouchers instead. Being a business class flight for 4 persons it's a fairly substantial amount.Let's consider the facts for a moment. Changing contract terms one-sided after the contract has been made, is clearly illegal and is not enforceable. Second, being an EU citizen, registered in an EU country and having paid with a credit card registered in the EU, the EU regulation clearly stated that airlines must provide a refund if they cancel a flight regardless of what they terms would have said.I'm currently processing a charge-back on the credit card. If they manage to somehow block that, I will have to take legal action."
591,"We were in the Philippines when emirates cancelled our return flight, we hade to make our own we back.  I immediately made a claim for a refund through their website.  After 6 weeks we rang to enquire about progress and they said they have changed their refund policy and we will have to apply again.  They did not inform us of this change until we contacted them.  Surely a policy cannot be changed for an exisitng order if it suits the company.  Otherwise there is no point in stating a policy.  Absolutely disgusted, will not use them again."
592,It wasn’t an easy process but so glad we could swap our flights to later this year. Thanks emirates
593,"Cancelled my flight,but apparently only the first of two legs. Impossible to get in touch with the local office, the complaint form never works...the whole administration has effectively vanished ! This is no way to deal with customers, i'm furious !"
594,"emirates is a corrupt useless demoralizing fraud company,emirates left me stranded in thailand with my severe chronic disability left for dead,emirates have no respect for customers at all only respect for money and huge profits,they left me for dead in thailand no help whatsoever,still waiting for refund no show yet,totally irresponsible pathetic damn corrupt arabs !!! i hope all tourists accross the world will remember in the future how emirates left us all human beings for dead in 3rd world countries and boycott this disgraceful airline in all future flying,i hope all emirates owners  suffer severe hardship and severe bad bad life as they have made us stranded tourists suffer,please do not fly with this horrible corrupt useless greed ridden arab useless airlines emirates !!!!"
595,"My son and girlfriend left stranded in Phuket by Emirates.They were on a 2 week holiday.Emirates flew them out there on14th March then sent a text on 22nd informing them their flight home on 28 March was cancelled.No advice on how they could contact them or alternative flight options home.Emirates did not answer phone calls,e mails nothing. Just left stranded.I had to Pay £2000 for Ethiad flight to get them home. They had to fly to Bangkok first, stay in a hotel overnight then catch the Ethiad flight.To date Emirates have only sent an automated response re claim for refund.Never again will we book with Emirates."
596,"Being ignored and getting the same  auto response messages is so aggravating and so unprofessional, let alone, we’ll over the time of promised refund😡"
597,"I was told my holiday was cancelled by my travel agent and I was refunded within 3 days, however I’m still waiting for a refund for the cost of upgraded seats that I booked direct with Emirates, they haven’t even made any contact about the flights being cancelled I’ve had to chase them up, I’ve filled out online form 2 weeks ago but heard nothing. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING CUSTOMER SERVICE and if I could score minus stars, I would!!!!"
598,"Called Emirates for a refund regarding the COVID 19 outbreak, it’s for upgrades to sears etc, told to fill in a quick form by the rudest assets that ever. Form filled in over 4 weeks ago, we would be back now, still no refund called again and was told minimum 90days and it was tough luck if I didn’t like it.Happy to take the money and smile not so great in a crisis."
599,"Flying from Perth to Dublin on 23rd March 2020 on Emirates. We brought our Flight forward by one week from 30th March to the 23rd March, because of Corona Virus. Said on their Website that it would be free to change dates of flight, but charged me £150.00. will not give refund.Also, the food on sector from Dubai to Dublin was not good, just a couple of sandwiches and some cake. Wheelchair service at Dubai also not good."
600,"If i could give this company NO stars i would cancelled our flights half way through our holiday in goa dont answer emails nothing about refunds no help at all just left us there to find our own way home, never again will i use this airline worse one yet, but they love to take your money"
601,"It’s a mistake to book flight with Emirates. Calls and emails .. nobody will reply. They only receive my money then cancel flight due to Covid-19. What about my refund .. Nobody from Emirates care , it’s not their fault !! Stupid airline with all stupid staff !!!The staff were trained to do CUT & PASTE reply or give irrelevant answers to address refund issues. I am holding Emirates tickets but they push me to online agent which has gone missing or not answering request or imposed heavy fee to initiate process .. As a reminder to Emirates, the agent is appointed by Emirates, Emirates can’t continue to hide.. STAND OUT and settle the refund!!"
602,"I have flown with Emirates several times now and each time the service has got worst. Now with the Coronavirus out break I could not fly,so I started a refund request looked easy but don't be fooled it's NOT . Today they tried to offer me travel vouchers instead of a refund I don't want them as I am looking at traveling with a different airline from now on over a month ago I applied for this refund and they are still trying to get out of it,wake up emerites you are going to lost customers in there droves which will cost you more. STOP BREAKING THE LAW over this as if you can do this what else are you not adering to is the safety of your passengers at risk as well ????"
603,"Like most other reviewers here, I am waiting for a refund for a flight that Emirates cancelled. They are charging me £200 for the privilege of asking for my money back. Disgusting.14 days ago they told me to expect to wait 2 to 3 weeks, today they are saying up to 90 days.Cathay Pacific gave me a FULL refund in just 10 days, no charges or deductions.I have lost all confidence and trust in Emirates Airlines."
604,"The customer services team have been very supportive with my enquires, however the underlying issues is not being resolved:- 07/03/2020: emirates cancelled my flights - 07/03/2020: via live chat, Emirates confirmed I am entitled to a full refund - 10/03/2020: Emirates supported in processing a refund request, recommended to wait at least 3 weeks, with an extra 2 weeks for refund to be processed, due to covid-19 backlog - 12/4/2020: Emirates given the option to: 'keep your ticket' or 'travel voucher', and if I wanted a refund I had to reprocess a refund request, as per completed 10/3/2020- 15/3/2020: Emirates processed a refund request on my behalf, and have highlighted I should expect the processing to take up to 90 days, as oppose to the original time frame of 3 weeksAll this going round in circles has made me lose confidence in emirates to actually deliver - based on my experiences, In combination with trend of comments on Trustpilot, I'm led to assume they are stalling all refunds, & encouraging flexible voucher options due to cash flow issues caused by the pandemicSimply put, they don't want money going out, given that money isn't coming into the business, at the present time This is not fair on the customers who do know have a clear/definitive time frame to fly"
605,"Disgusting service from a multi billion pound company, blatantly flouting EU and UK law. Altering their terms and conditions during a time of crisis to profit from their customers.I am in no position as a small business owner, taking a financial hit, to take a credit note for a future flight as i doubt i will be flying anywhere in the next few years.All we can do as customers is never fly with their airline again. Hopefully this crisis will come to an end soon but as consumers never forget who displayed decency and who chose to profit from us the people who fund their company.Shame on you Emirates"
606,"Second review about emirates and the scam cancellation policy they have put in place.As per previous review not only was I quoted a full refund but then pushed onto another date since accepting the £200 fee to get the remaining balance back it’s been nearly 3 weeks and no contact confirming this is being processed.I then called and was quoted up to 90 days, previously I could of got it back the same day and no charge.Will never book business with an airline that does business likes this again, appreciate its hard times for travel industry but personal circumstances of people have also been hit."
607,Emerites made up some bogus cancellation/refund policies which my flight was booked before this coronavirus incident and are wanting to charge a fee on there own flights which been cancelled of 200 pounds if you don't take credit . The agency I booked with has also added a fee of 50 pounds to. Complete joke to profit of people in a bad suitation. 100 percent a joke and a greedy scam. They're happy for you to be stuck in your transfered flight and happy for people to be stuck abroad. They said my flight is going ahead but Sri Lanka airport site says cancelled with closures till mid April. Hood thing Lloyd's have be brilliant and I will be getting my money back soon
608,Had flights booked for the summer and with the Cover-19 Virus pandemic we are unable to comit to our trip. The Emirates Travel Consultant was very helpful and the Airline has allowed us to re-book anytime in the next two years from the date of booking.
609,Quoting 8 weeks to refund cancelled holiday money! Shameful! I will not use them again!
610,"I have always flown with emirates.  It Used to be a top airline however, this last trip has been ‘budget airline’ grade service from the outset.  The cleanliness of the plane was dire, the meals were few and far between and no regular drinks, and the staff are obviously unhappy in their workplace. With the complications of boarders closing and the subsequent cancellations of flights we entered the realms of trying to get a refund.  We eventually got told that there is no chance of a refund.  They issue vouchers for the same route only for the cost of the ticket price we paid.  If we were to travel the route and apply the vouchers, we will still be expected to pay admin fees and any other differences in ticket cost dependant on final ticket price.  Complicated. And valid for 12 months only. It’s theft.  Who the hell can afford to have two holidays in New Zealand in a year ?!?!  Emirates, people will remember your greed in times of need.  This will not go away as we will remember the way in which you disregarded your once loyal customers. The emirates brand is now a budget airline with budget airline tactics. Pay the extra £100 and fly with Qatar, Singapore, Malaysian.  Avoid this shower of sheit.  Run by greedy accountants and it shows."
611,"Despite a bad experience earlier in the year. I booked a trip to Bangkok in January, but could not go due to lockdown etc. Was refunded promptly including the seating fees and points. They have gone up in my estimation and will use them when everything is sorted and normality eventually resumes."
612,"Like most people on here, we too had our flights (Mauritius via Dubai) cancelled. EC261/2004 clearly states that any flight leaving an EU airport (including the UK until the end of 2020) is legally entitled to a full cash refund. Emirates are blatantly ignoring this and charging customers the cancellation fee stated on their ticket conditions, that is if they can get a response from them. This is blatantly fraudulent and it is my hope that when flights do resume worldwide, customers will turn their backs on this airline."
613,"Terrrible company! We have cancelled our Economy Flex tickets (which is fully refundable) on 16/03 and were advised to get our refund within 15 business days. We have got nothing! In all my attempts to contact them, they don't respond, their website is dead-end with not useful information. AVOID, unless you want loss money."
614,No refund for flights cancelled as a result of COVID-19 is unacceptable.
615,"Like so many others we were delayed in Dubai airport for 6 hours on the 23 March 2020. Passengers where travelling from all over the world returning due to the Coronavirus. We were ushered into the departure lounge at the gate in good time for our flight. Everyone was expected to sit in very close proximity to one another with no hand sanitizer or face masks. This showed Emirates complete disregard for their passengers health and wellbeing. We were eventually given a food voucher after 4 hours of sitting around but still no information about why we were delayed! I have since submitted a claim for the 6 hours delay in arriving at Edinburgh. I have received an email from Emirates stating I was not entitled to compensation because the delay was due to ""organisational reasons"". Therefore it was not their fault!  This is absolute nonsense. Who is responsible for the efficient running and operation of Emirates airline if not Emirates! There are laws to protect and compensate passengers who experience delay and or cancellation of flights yet Emirates are flaunting them and refusing to carry through their responsibility. There must be another recourse passengers can take so if anyone can advise my next step I would be very appreciative. I will not travel with Emirates again after reading the reviews and my personal experience."
616,"I would give it 0 if I could. Have flown with them for many years but on 23 March, the day we were due to fly home to Uk from Maldives they shut Dubai airport. We had no notification from them and have not had anything from them since. Unable to contact them.They should have sent a couple of planes to Male to  pick up all their abandoned passengers.My travel company says it is extremely unlikely to get a refund from them for a very long time, if ever.It cost us £2000 to get back to UK.We will never fly with them again."
617,Only 1 star as can't give 0.Poor attitude with regards to covid cancellations. They should be offering customers full refunds and not just money grabbing or charging customers for flights that they as the airline has cancelled.
618,"Cancelled flight, will not refund ticket despite it being in breach of EU regulation. They have changed the information available to customers regarding COVID-19The week before they grounded flights it offered a refund option, now it only mentioms rebooking and voucher. Misleading customer by withholding information, disgusting. I have screenshots to prove this."
619,"What an absolute disgrace Emirates is not refunding customers money for flights cancelled by them. Under European law they are legally obliged to refund the customer within 7 days.Instead they choose to feather there own nest notwithstanding they are owned by one of the richest states in the World. They have no corcern for customers whise income has completely stopped due to Covid 19. I will be struggling to put food on the table whilst Emirates play fast and loose with customers lives. They should take a long hard look at their values .There website slogan says ""we're with you every step of the way"" If thats true then why are they being so obstructive."
620,"Emirates robbed your money in the disaster of COVID-19. They changed the refund policy and then cancelled all the flights and shutdown the airport (if you are aware of the fact that Emirates is state-owned). No REFUND of passenger's earned money for the flights cancelled by them!Moreover, it is a clear breach of UK/EU Air Passenger Rights and breaking the law. What a joke for a MNC."
621,"We bought tickets onboard Emirates flight for a show in Dubai. A total of 300$.When we landed in Dubai we found out that the show was not running the 4 days that we were in Dubai. Ridiculous! Waited to 1,5 month to get a qucik reply from customer service that they will not refund."
622,"My wife and I recently purchased return flights business class from Manchester to Perth, Australia costing as you can imagine several thousands of pounds. The flight out was good and we have no complaints about that, only praise. However, with little or no notice we were told that Emirates had not only cancelled our return flight but refused to offer us any assistance to get home. As such our return home was greatly delayed with all the upset this involved and at additional inflated cost by another airline. The icing on the cake was when we were informed today by our holiday booking company that Emirates would NOT consider a refund, even though THEY cancelled the flight until TELVE MONTHS after the original booking was made. Then I was told not to expect a full refund as this was they way Emirates normally worked. Amazing!!!"
623,Appaling customer service! After our flight was cancelled we could not get in touch with anyone. We could not get our money back !!!
624,"EVen though Emirates could not fly and cancelled the flight this is what they said and they lost my complaint:Hi Neil,I'm sorry this has affected your travel plans.I understand you no longer wish to travel and want to get a full refund.Since the cancellation of the flights happened because of circumstances beyond our control, the cancellation charge of GBP200 per ticket will apply.You can request refund here. Due to the volume of refund requests, the process can take up to 90 days. (refund minus the charge per ticket). We have an option though to keep the tickets open for 2 years or exchange them to a travel voucher. You can call us or check this link for more details.Regards,Dave, Emirates Social Media TeamMy response Dave that is unacceptable. There were U.K. mandates and Singapore government mandates to NOT travel at the time of the flights. This is still in place now and will still be in place on our return leg. This is NOT optional advice. For example in the case of Singapore we wouldn’t not be able to enter the country. Dubai also closed its borders and we would have been stuck there if we ignored government warnings. Therefore you could not honour the flight and nor could we. It’s force majeure and we are entitled by by UK statutory rights to receive a full refund. Please explain why have Emirates not responded and I suspect lost my complaint. I will only accept a full refund includes by the original changes we made because the flight itself was not possible.I received a refund from my bankWill not fly Emirates ever again, if everyone does that Emirates will loose out."
625,"Literally the worst treatment/ expierience of my life which left me upset/ crying for the forth coming 30 hour journey in regards to one of your staff, working as a team leader at the checking in desk at Manchester Airport Terminal 1. The name shown on her badge appeared Lauren Buckley. I arrived at departures at 3.30pm, my flight scheduled for 8.40pm. I arrived early because I was aware that the checking in process was going to be a complicated one, due to the new guidelines that had been set following the COVID19 pandemic in New Zealand. I had had several conversations with Immigration New Zealand (INZ) in regards to my return to my home country. I met the eligibilty criteria, to be granted exemption, following the announcement that only Permanent residents and citizens of New Zealand will be allowed to return to NZ, unless they meet the exemption criteria which is being looked at on a case by case basis QUOTE 1 - Humanitarian reasons, 2 Health and other essential workers, 3 the holder of a visitor visa who is the partner of a temporary work or student visa holder, and who normally LIVES IN NZ AND IS IN NZ. 1 - I meet criteria 1 because I left my 2 young children in NZ to travel to UK for only 7days with my 1 yr old baby because my Father was critical in ICU, and it was suggested that this may be the last time I see him. - i had evidence for this. 2 - meet critteria 2 as I am a physiotherapist working in essential services in NZ. 3 - I also meet criteria 3!! I explained that I had had a conversation with INZ and they said I meet the criteria and they will need to confirm details. However, YOUR INCOMPETENT AND MISLEADING MEMBER OF STAFF, told me that she had told all this and that INZ were not interestedShe basically was NOT slighly interested &  I know she didnt tell them because I hadnt given Lauren any information!!!!, had all my documents at hand waiting to show her to confirm INZ that I have proof of everything that they request. Lauren denied my boarding onto the plane without knowing the full facts. She did not seem to be concerned that she is spltting me up from my 7yr old and 4 yr old children in NZ, apart from the fact  she was heartless and careless, inhumane! More importantly she Even more so, she lied to me about the info she gave INZ and was imcompitent in her treatment of me & did not act according to guidelines set by governments  at a very difficult time. Following this i had a massive breakdown, and then managed to pull myself together to communicate with the most wonderful man in the airport at your official desk Maz. He was explaining to INZ, but because Lauren had already given them the false information about mt hey didn't understand the situation. The lady on the phone was the same lady that Lauren had spoken to, Maz eventually said that it will best that I speak with them directly. He passed me the phone and I explained my situation and within a 15min phone conversation, my access was granted and I was given the clear to board my flight to NZ, I had all the evidence they required. I am absolutely disgusted that such an incompetent person is given such powers who doesn't know how to manage such powers. I highly suggest that this woman is revoked of her position!! UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF DISCLOSING CORRECT INFORMATION  and an apology!"
626,"Really BAD SERVICE related to Emirates cancelling all flights as of 25th of March. Had booked a flight from Auckland to Copenhagen on the 28th of March - booked through a travel agency (Tripmonster/Momond) as Emirates website didn't work properly. As Emirates chose to cancel all flights they DON'T REFUND the ticket but only offer a voucher. As I had to find another solution to fly back home I have now paid for 2 tickets and can't get my money back for the cancelled flight due to ""Emirates company policy"". I will not fly with Emirates ever again and will strongly advice everybody else not to."
627,"I was on emirate’s flight EK17 on 9/02/2020 from Dubai Airport to Manchester Airport with the scheduled departure time of 07:10. This flight arrived at Manchester Airport on 10 February instead on 9 February, with a 28 hours delay after being diverted to Frankfurt due to a storm Ciara.I understand that weather can be unpredictable but Emirates should have known the storm could affect flights and should have prepared better to handle the situation. Why did we set off to Manchester if it was known that storm Ciara was affecting air transit? Passengers, myself included, were literally scared to death. We flew in circles for an hour, during which there were two failed attempted landings to Manchester Airport. The turbulences experienced were very bad. Many passengers were throwing up. This was by far my worst experience with an airline and the only reason I selected Emirates was because I believed it to be one of the best airlines. During the delay, I was provided with dinner and hotel accommodation. However, throughout the process, I received no updates from Emirates regarding the flight. The staff at the hotel did not know when we would be scheduled for flying to Manchester and I had to check at reception late at night to find out that we had been out on a flight at 10am. This is not something one would look forward to after a 28-hour journey. We had to take a coach to the airport at 5:30am even though the check-in desk did not open till 7am. Once we boarded, we had to wait another two hours because the plane needed to be checked by an engineer. Could this not have been done before passengers boarded?Upon arrival I had to call a taxi because my partner was in work and was unable to pick me up. The delay also resulted in me having to work extra hours to compensate for a lost day of work since I was due to return to the office on Monday, 10 February.Emirates have not offered any financial compensation for this even though they are bound to do so by European legislation – at least for the flight from Frankfurt to Manchester, which had a 3h delay."
628,"Do not book with this airline.  As a result of Covid-19, flights have cancelled and these greedy folks want to keep majority of the fares. In these unprecedented times Emirates is still exploiting vulnerable and poor people!!! They do not care"
629,"Had return flights from Singapore to Manchester booked for 27th March 2020. Heard today (23rd) via local news Emirates to cease flights as of 25th so went to airport Emirates desk to be told all flights that go to uk are now fully booked and they cannot do anything to help us until possibly April. But we had booked flights, so why not offer an alternative to us. Cannot help!! Basically, go away. I received NO EMAILS, NO TEXTS, NOTHING!!! Thanks Emirates ☹️☹️😭"
630,"It is pure logic that airlines has to cancel flights in thiese times; however emirates canceled all flights after 25/3 with only 2 days notice.This means your costumars don’t have sufficient time to rebook, and neither does your own staff which has been unreachable for 2 days now. You could have given 7 days notice so your costumers had a chance to react.Shame on u Emirates.I will never fly with you again, and allways remember to share my story with all frequent flyers I know."
631,"'The worlds largest carrier' a turnover of billions of pounds manipulating customers into accepting a travel voucher which may not be worth anything in the current climate. No one knows when the travel restrictions will be lifted or how bad the virus transmission will get and whether travel insurance will even provide cover therefore it is extremely unfair for Emirates to be greedy and not care about their customers in this difficult periodExpedia actually sent me an email asking me if I wanted to cancel for a full refund, other smaller companies who I had booked tours with were extremely empathetic and offered a refund straight away. After finding out on thursday that Australia had closed their borders I rang them and was told that their systems have not been updated showing this information but if the flight to Brisbane is cancelled I will get a full refund. Called back two days later and was told they can only offer a rebooking or travel voucher as my flight is non refundable. She advised me that i would need to fill out the request form in order to obtain either a refund of only the taxes or a travel voucher. This is extremely deceiving as they are making customers fill out a cancellation form in order to get a travel voucher even though the flight is already suspended at their end. They are telling customers that their flight is non refundable ticket so their only option is a travel voucher, making out they are doing you a favour. When the non-refundable ticket only applies when the customer cancels the flight not when the airline does it. As the airline has cancelled the flight under Rule EC 261 any flight that departs from Europe that is cancelled is eligible for a refund to the original form of payment."
632,"Emirates noticeably altered their website this week from offering refunds to to only offering vouchers for travel in the next year. How appalling that this airline assumes all will want to travel in the coming year or indeed be able to travel. As an airline operating from one of the wealthiest countries in the world I am encouraged by their complete lack of decency and thoughtless, selfish actions that put many people in difficult positions through no fault of their own. They should refund and live with the consequences of the awful situation the world finds itself in just as many other businesses will have to do. Fleecing their patrons won't do them any good in future."
633,"No customer service no reply to email tweet phone calls. Flights booked uk to Australia for Easter and been advised no refund and vouchers valid 1 year from booking. I booked in nov 2019 so Oz will be in shut down still nov 2020 so can’t use them either. Flight no longer bookable on website but still no refund. Credit card company won’t refund as service may still be provideAll other parts of trip hotel, lounge, Airbnb all fully refunded. EMIRATES YOU ARE TOTAL CROOKS"
634,"I am due to fly to Bali via Dubai on Saturday (21st March) with Emirates. Having taken out insurance with Admiral prior to the severity of Coronavirus had hit the UK. Since then an FCO has been stating no travel unless considered essential should be taken. Although there has been no border closures nor flight cancellations, it would be inhumane to put ourselves in the situation of taking this flight and trip for the situation to worsen or infact mean we are stuck abroad. Admiral have shown little to no remorse for not providing information on how to deal with the insurance, and has purely ensured that they are in a better financial situation than their customers. Emirates have ignored all means of communication meaning that we do not know where we stand regarding moving the flights to later in the year or getting money back for not being able to fly. Booking.com alike has not met the standards expected by their customers when going through a time of such uncertainty and stress. I would highly recommend not using Admiral or Booking.com as neither can provide you with a sufficient amount of customer care required. PLEASE RESPOND BY call or 07880558295"
635,A 5-star airline that is worse than a budget airline in this COVID-19 crisis. AirBnB and easyJet have fully refunded my domestic tickets around Europe but this greedy airline will not budge. We will never fly Emirates again.
636,"In the age of CoronaVirus where people are struggling to get their tickets cancelled, I have had a nightmarish experience with the travel partner. However, even though I booked through a third party, I was able to get through to someone at Emirates after staying in queue for 2 hours. In current circumstances getting through to an agent should also be considered positive. I was due to fly in less than 48 hours and I would anyway not be able to travel. Again thanks to this agent, he was able to cancel my tickets and avoided having to go through a no show and loose money. Now I will have to follow up with my travel partner which is nightmarish but kudos emirates for understanding and helping your customer. You have now earned a loyal customer. How you keep this up."
637,YOUR WEBSITE IS NOT ACCEPTING MY COMPLAINTEmirates website clearly states that it is the customers responsibility to check travel restrictions for the countries they are flying to. This is exactly what i did. I checked in online and was ready to board at london gatwick. i kept myself up to date with Malaysia news and it was being discussed to close their borders. I therefore decided against travelling to protect myself. Within an hour Malaysia confirmed they have gone lockdown and banned foreigners. I will like a full refund as the UK government confirmed no travel to malaysia on 16th March. You cannot penalise me for making the right decision as i knew Malaysia is going lockdown. Please process a full refund. I will take matters further by contacting the BBC regarding my case if i do not hear from you within 2 weeks which i believe is sufficient time for a response.
638,I booked a flight to Cape Town in South Africa last September. Flight dates would have been outbound 25.03.2020 and return 13.04.2020. It is now clear for several days that South Africa has closed down the country and that flights should therefore be cancelled and refunded. Emirates however have still not informed me about the cancellation of the flight. Their conditions document is absolutely non-sensical and unclear about what cancellation fees will be applied in this scenario. I am getting zero information via email and the hotlines have a 6 hour waiting time. Callback requests are just ignored. I looks like Emirates are planning to fob everyone off by claiming that these flights are officially not cancelled. I expect better from a supposedly tier 1 airline. This customer service is extremely poor. I expect a full refund for this. My opinion about this airline has radically changed. I will never use them again and I advise everyone else to stay clear of them as well.
639,Refuse to call back or answer phone or emails.. states above & beyond service due to corona virus but don`t even meet absolute minimum standards by the common decency of a reply. obviously they intend to blatantly steal my £2500 without refunding or changing my flight due to new Zealand lock down... disgusted.. will NEVER use this company again..Robbers
640,"I booked on emirates airline through travelup. Emirates rebooked my flight and changed my destination city without my confirmation, emirates send me email stating ""If your agent is unable to help you with your booking you can talk to us now using Live Chat."" I contacted emirates chat and told them I refuse to land in a different city far away. I requested emirates to rebook my flight on different dates or give me voucher, emirates refused to help.  emirates told me to go back to travel agent (travel up) & this travel agent didn't pickup phone trying since yesterday. They are trying to scam people. zero stars for both Travel Up and emirates"
641,"I had a return ticket on February 12, 2020. I had severe pain on my back . I went to Emirates Airlines office in Kolkata, India and asked one of their staff, Mr. Goldstein, to issue a  ticket as early as possible as I am having severe pain in my back and asked the rep if can give me ticket on Feb 2,3, 4 and he told me he will issue a ticket on 4th and give me an itinerary which I didn't review  because of my severe pain and left their Kolkata office in good faith. I went to the airport found out there was no flight on Feb. 4. It was my fault I didn't review the itinerary. I requested him a available flight as early as possible. I didn't expect that he booked me flight for march 4 which was a flight one month later ( if the rep told me he couldn't find any earlier flight I could fly on Feb 12 as scheduled ). Emirates can blame me technically for sure. But I was asking early flight to return home as early as possible because of his severe pain. I am sure Mr. Goldstein, customer service rep, understood that was not early flight, I could return home on February 12 in a normal situation, I would appreciate if Emirates customer service would consider my ordeal and return excess fare I paid for the flight on March 4 with no fault of mine . Customer service rep. Mrs. Simpson email me from Newyork and stated Kolkata office send me a confirmation by email so she can't refund the money for my first ticket but I didn't have online access in Kolkata where I was travelling. I trusted the customer service I went to the Airport and waited three hours and found out there was no flight that day.  I send three email including one to customer service manager to review the case,  I am sorry i did not get any reply from them. I spend two hours on the road and three hours in the airport with severe pain. Next day, I went Emirates office and told the manager what I went through. He listened to me and give the ticked for 05 Feb2020 and told me to file a complain to New York office if I wish because the man issued the wrong ticket was absent that day so the he couldn't verify the issue.

I AM COMPLAING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE IN NEWYORK."
642,"Further to my previous review. I did finally speak to someone at Emirates who told me to fill in a form on their website and because my trip was cancelled because of Coronavirus they would give me a refund. Today I received an e-mail from them from an unanswerable box just saying that the seat reservation fees were non refundable. Cunard cancelled my cruise and one of Emirates own companies , Imagine Travel cancelled the flights but they will not give me my money back. Do not travel with this airline!!! Their customer service is abysmal. Please join me in boycotting this bunch of thieves, travel with anybody else because there can be nobody worse!"
643,"Boycott the EMIRATES Company (Dubai), their uncivil behavior towards the Corona virus or Covid 129 goes completely against the timid efforts of European airlines which they at least reimburse cancellations linked to Covid, or offer to postpone flights free of charge. Servioce à bord déplorable et on aimable. A EVITER !"
644,We have just arrived at newcastle airport and checked in .A lovley girl who checked us in who works for swiss port was exceptionally helpful with her assistance .The girls name was Natalie .She is a credit to your company .Also the girls at the Emirates desk helped my friend with his return flight .He was going to be stuck in Dubai for 24 hours but they changed his flight to a complete  new time to help .Well done to the whole team at Newcastle .Many thanks Alan Dinning
645,"Worst service I've ever had! Beware!! Terrible rude, cold, brusque staff. Tiny baggage allowance - half any other airline. My daughter booked with Emirates as she thought it was good customer service - how wrong can you be. She paid a lot for her ticket and then misread the baggage allowance. Their web site is very badly designed and unclear. At the airport the check in staff were rude and dismissive and completely unsympathetic to a genuine mistake and also to genuine distress. My daughter was so upset at having to literally put half her belongings in the bin. The Emirates staff were smirking and totally uncaring. They also wanted to completely rip her off by charging an extortionate £600 for an extra bag!  Avoid this heartless and disgraceful airline at all costs - they truly do not care and will take as much money from you as they can. Terrible service. It also took me over an hour to submit a complaint as the form ""doesn't work"" very well - obstructive and extortionate. Never again"
646,"We were flying from Birmingham to Dubai, Dubai to Melbourne. Initially we thought we had booked with Qantas but unfortunately it was operated by Emirates. We travelled on 26.01.20 and 27.01.20 We weren’t able to log a seat preference, as Emirates system kept telling us to try again later. When we arrived at BHX the check in assistant said he’d given me an aisle seat for both flights. I requested this specifically, as medically I need to be able to get out of my seat during a long flight. When we boarded the second flight, we realised he had put my husband in the aisle and me in the middle seat, this wasn’t a problem as we swopped. There was a small child sitting in the window seat. (6 year old.) We were just wondering who he was with, when the stewardess said he was a minor, and told me I had to swop with him, as regulations said he should sit in the aisle seat. I said I wasn’t able to do this as I had specifically told staff I need to get out easily. She went away, then a while later reinforcements arrived, the person said he was the purser, he said I had to change seats. He was extremely unpleasant and aggressive. I said we would move anywhere else as long as I had an aisle seat. He said I had to sit in the middle as regulations said my husband couldn’t sit next to the child, (regulations kept changing) This was extremely stressful and greatly upsetting. The journey was 13.5 hours and I didn’t want to feel responsible for a small child to whom I wasn’t even related. I needed to sleep on that leg of the journey- not child mind. I think it’s disgusting that a customer isn’t told that they are put beside a minor on such a long journey. The purser wasn’t trying to solve the  problem he wasn’t taking the trouble to find out why I needed to sit there...or asking anyone else to change, we had reached the stage where we were getting taken off the aircraft, it was only that another passenger offered for his teenager to swop with me (to seat him closer to his family) Then a woman on her own said she’d swop with my husband. Emirates staff were dreadful, the purser was nasty there are ways of treating people and this wasn’t it.  I was a wreck, stressed out, not the type of experience that was good for me as I’d had a stroke 2 years ago ...so was worried about the long flights anyway. It took me a long time to get over this, and Emirates staff should be mindful when dealing with people as they don’t seem to think anyone already has issues. A footnote for anyone thinking of sending their child on their own as a minor...the stewardess’s paid very little attention to that child, I only saw one speak to him twice.On the return journey from Dubai the checkin person said she couldn’t give me an aisle seat again, luckily the man sitting there kindly swooped. Our flight from Melbourne to  Perth on the 12 February 20 was with Qantas...what a difference the cabin crew were friendly and couldn’t do enough for you."
647,I have flown with Emirates on a number of occasions in recent yearsfrom London to Dubai. On my last 3 flights the customer service on the flights has been greatly lacking. I would go as far as to say the cabin staff act as if the customers are a great inconvenience to  them. They are literally just doing thir job not very efficiently and without warmth and personality. Such a shame for an airline who over the years has enjoyed a good reputation.
648,I booked the return flight for my parents. Due to genuine reason/coronovirus issue I'm requesting to alter the return flight but airline is asking more money then I can buy new one way ticket online. Will never travel by Emirates again!!!!!
649,"Recently flew with Emirates business class to Bali, both partner and I save extremely hard to make our holiday special and normally we would fly with Qatar, who,by the way,offer an excellent business class product, but with the convenience of flying from our local airport, we decided to give them a try. I can honestly say that this was the biggest mistake ever, the crew,although friendly enough were obviously going through the motions of service, absolutely no warmth whatsoever, just a feeling of,right let's get this over with. The food quality was appalling and looked like economy offerings dumped on a small plate, having to disturb a crew member to ask for a drink?This experience of their business class product was disappointing to say the least and one never to be repeated, I actually feel ripped off and angry."
650,They didn't let my partner board a connecting flight where the connection was 1hour 50 minutes and next gate was more than an hour away and she got 10 minutes before. Be careful of these Arab airlines. All Talk and no service or respect wether a baby is there with short supply of food. They rather you died with your money in there pocket.
651,"Shame Emirates are profiteering from the corona-virus outbreak 🤑After my wife has just beaten cancer for a second time, had booked a cruise from Dubai heading east.  Not wishing to be on the next plague ship, we cancelled and got a full refund for the cruise and Emirates flights from the travel agent, but Emirates refusing to refund the seat allocations booked and paid for directly.Clearly the cruise company and travel agents aren't profiteering, but Emirates are happy to.  Shame on you. 😔"
652,"I have always used Emirates as I like that airline  and they have a big fleet to cover many destinations. My recent travel to Dhaka was awful. Not only they were very delayed they also lost my luggage. Imagine flying to a foreign country and you lost all your belongings and gifts you bought for family. When I reported the luggage lost they said give us 6 weeks. After 6 weeks they got back saying that that they need evidence of all my purchases to compensate for my luggage lost. My question is who keeps a receipts of small purchases and for your own clothes.Just to show you all the email they sent me I have attached it. This is their response.“Thank you for your continued patience with this matter.  Regrettably, our Central Baggage Tracing Office has informed us that they have not been able to locate your luggage and we would now consider the item lost. At this juncture, I wish to advise that in the event of damage, loss and delay to baggage, our liability, in accordance with our Conditions of Carriage, is limited and subject to proof of loss. Therefore please forward the applicable proofs of purchase for the items noted on your Baggage Inventory Form. As soon as I have received these documents I will be able to fully evaluate your claim and will contact you again.Yours sincerely Henriette EspersenEmirates Customer Affairs”Awful, and very sad for a biggest airliner."
653,"I booked Emirates online ticket via Fly365.com, for me and my family to fly on a very important trip. I can not understand how Emirates have contact numbers for Fly.365.com, but with these contact numbers we are not able to contact the company at all. According to Emirates these tickets were cancelled. We received no correspondence regarding cancellation. Surely if Emirates can see these information, then they do business with Fly365.com and then this company has a connection with Emirates. At one stage this company was appointed by Emirates or authorized by Emirates to sell Emirates tickets which we paid for, but are now cancelled, without any refunds. We need assistance to resolve the above a.s.a.p. if anybody have advice please inform me."
654,Worst customer service ever they should fix up
655,"Check in was great, staff were very friendly and had no issues once seated. Seats were comfy and entertainment choices were great, however the staff on board both to and from Dubai let Emirates down. A simple drink of water when asked seemed like the staff were being put out and we felt like a inconvenience. I myself have diabetes and when my blood sugars went low my husband requested a glass of coke and once again we were made to feel like a burden. Constantly banged into by staff and never once did they apologise. Very disappointing for Emirates"
656,Horrible customer service! They change the policy for the luggage and I know as always that I can fly with 2 baggage but I find out to late that I can bring just one ... as a family they had 400$ extre for two extra baggage! Shame on them!!!
657,Bad and indecent staffAirhostess think they are boss and we are servantsTerrible..
658,Rubbish never again they booked wrong tickets and blam me.
659,"I shouldn't give them one star but I have no choice. Where to start from Kyiv to Dubai I was looking for a premium ticket on sky scanner so I had a lot of choices Flydubai was £148 and Emirate £208 and others were cheaper one way so I decided book Emirate as everyone says number one airline so arrived at the airport check-in desk they said no emirate today flydubai only you have to fly with I said to them no way I paid more for Emirate Flydubai were cheaper when I booked this ticket can you refund me the money they simply say no huh I ask them to refund me a partial they said no again so I said to them how come you sell Emirate ticket and boarding people with cheaper airline that is not right, I had enough with them. I get on board flydubai looking very cheap you have to pay for everything I was not happy what I see, however, I said can I have a meal and drink they said you need to pay which I supposed to get free meal and drinks I said okay can I pay by debit card they said credit card only I said to them I have Pound cash and Ukrainian money they said no dollar and credit card so disappointed no food no drink for the whole journey. When I arrived at my hotel I noticed my luggage tyre is broken so I called emirate customer service they was very rude not even feel sorry for what happened for what I experience, I will never fly with them again and wouldn't recommend emirate to anyone stay away from them."
660,"What used to be the #1 Airline in the World is now the worst, rude and arrogant airline in the World. Emirates denies my request for a complimentary hotel for more than 22 hours layover in Dubai to Canada. I called the customer service, and they say our duration is long, there's no earliest flight available, BUT our ticket pricing criteria is less than USD 1000. I bought my tickets for USD 1300+ each. Really? Come up with a better excuse EMIRATES. At the time of booking, a passenger is not given an option to select your criteria. We're presented with dates, timings, and pricing. We select the best options and that's what I did. Your earliest flight from Dubai to Canada was after 22hours upon my arrival in Emirates from my home country. I will never fly on Emirates again!"
661,"We boarded our flight and proceeded to wait on the tarmac for 3.5 HOURS!!  The flight was then canceled but because we started calling customer service while on the tarmac we were 2 of 300+ people that were able to get on the next flight which then waited on the tarmac for 1 MORE HOUR making us miss our connecting flight which then made us miss our next connection.The worst part was when we got to Dubai we had a 5 hour layover until our next rebooked flight.  Emirates wouldn't get us a hotel because it was less than 8 hours AND they wouldn't let us in their lounge because we weren't business class.We SAT at the airport 2 hrs for our flight, we SAT on the tarmac for 3.5 hours, then we SAT on the tarmac for 1 hour, then we SAT on the flight for 4 hours and got to the airport and were told there was no compensation, no accommodations, no customer service...we needed to SIT at the airport for 5 hours until we could SIT on our 14 hour flight!!  What?!?!We spoke w 3 different representatives at different counters as well as customer service on the phone and Emirates refused to take any responsibility for 2 extremely late flights and the nightmare we were going through.I heard Emirates air was nice and took care of their customers but that is definitely NOT TRUE!WORST AIRLINE EXPERIENCE EVER!!"
662,"I flew to Sydney in November 2019 Business Class and if you are going on a night flights do not expect service as it is minimal.  Out of 4 flights only 1 was as I expected it to be.  I have been complaining since my return in December and quite basically they have ignored all my points.  In particular why there was no service on my first flight, why on the 2nd flight they sent all the service staff for a break in the middle of service and 3rd why my car did not turn up to take us to the Airport at the end of our holiday.  I have continually written, phoned, used the chat line to no avail.  The customer Hype they give to Excellent Customer Service is exactly that, Hype.  I would never recommend this airline to family or friends.  I can only say I am extremely disappointed in the lack of meaningful communication."
663,"I took  the Emirates fron California to Dubai, it was a 17 horrible flight. one of the passengers who was from south Africa  had a long time chat and drinking sessions with his mates. their loud voices and laughing made it impossible for me to sleep. when I  complained  to the attendant he didn't do anything just to  maintain the glamorous  name of their airlines.I don't recommend any one to take  this company"
664,"We flew from Johannesburg to London Business class via Dubai in January . Two of our bags arrived but my bag with all my summer clothes in it did not arrive . Usual filling in forms etc . Emirates have not contacted me once about my bag . I have had to phone them everyday only to be told they don’t know where my bag is . I was told to fill in a complaints form &  I will hear from them in 30 days . What good is that when I have no clothes , underwear of toiletries ??? I have had to spend hundreds of pounds buying basics . They have ruined my stay in London . I am about to go on a cruise & have no summer clothes . The worst customer service I have ever experienced"
665,"Worst experience ever, suitcases broke and wasted our time filling out the compensation forms but no communication after that.Lost the phone and no communication was made.waste of time,waste of money."
666,"Extremely bad country to live!!! Specially if u get kids, then u will suffer more coz of expensive care of your kid. No lifeee in this idiotic country...finished 11 years and i regret of this slave life! Dont go there at any cost."
667,"I will never fly Emirates again. Can you believe they do not have a medical emergency policy?! My wife has been diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis and has been in the Neuro ICU since Christmas (12/25/2019) morning. We had planned a trip to Dubai never expecting that something like this would happen. She is still unresponsive and will not be be fully recovered for months. Recovery could even take years. I called the airline and they said they would not issue a refund. The only way they would issue a refund would be upon death. They will not even give me credit. The only thing they would allow me to do would be to rebook the flight, pay $300 per person change fees and the difference in airfare. Unbelievable!"
668,"Nightmare in Dubai on the 11th . The flight to Dubai was postponed and we were given a hotel in Manchester . Then we reached Dubai and absolutely no support at all in Dubai! Everyone was so angry and upset 0n the 12 and the 13th , We were hanging around in Dubai airport and ho hotel or any other support! Disgraceful EMIRATES should hang their head in shame! We will never ever travel with them again!"
669,"I am a frequent flyer with Emirates and have  used them regularly for years to fly between Australia and the UK in business class. Having been delighted with them initially I have found the service has declined steadily over the years. The flight to London Gatwick yesterday from Dubai was awful. The toilets were dirty, the food really terrible and the staff disinterested. This seems to be the pattern now and the lovely planes, food and service is a thing of the past. I will be seeking another airline to do my long haul flights with in the future."
670,"I booked a surprise holiday for my Wife and I  on Monday 27th January 2020 with Travel Republic going to Dubai on the 6th October 2020 returning the 20th October 2020.After booking I told her the following day and she made me aware I had booked a family trip with my sons and wives  to watch Simply Red in Concert in Manchester on the 17th October which obviously clashed.Feeling gutted I contacted Travel Republic and explained the situation to them asking if I could forward the holiday by say 5 days to the 1st October and they said that although they could alter the dates for the Hotel and Transfers the Flight tickets were Non-Refundable and I would be charged the approx. £800 for flights if I cancelled.I contacted Emirates Airlines and they said there contract did state non-refundable  ( which I found later it did ) so I asked in the circumstances and being over 8 months away if they could waiver the full charge, I would pay a charge for admin cancellation and also book the same flights with them but 5 days earlier but they said they were not prepared to do this.In the circumstances I think this very unreasonable of them being such a long way from departure. They would surely sell On 2 seats in 8 months In the event, I am absolutely gutted, to not be able to attend the concert with my family but cannot afford to pay an additional circa £800 as they require.Be very careful you don’t fall into the same trap of Missing  the small print and being faced with unreasonable customer service help. I have always thought Very highly of Emirates but afraid this episode has certainly changed my mind."
671,THE most uncomfortable seat I have ever sat on on a plane. Get rid of those nightmare head cushion things PLEASE!
672,"Flight to Dubai delayed 14 hours in Manchester.  Arrived for connection in Dubai to have to wait 3 days!  I know there was a flood, this is not uncommon in Dubai but why fly my family into utter and complete chaos?  It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  Queues for 15 hours...unable to leave the queue to go the toilet because you would not get back in.  Fellow customers and staff hostile and aggressive in the queue and Emirates did nothing, absolutely nothing to alleviate the situation.  Spent 4 days getting to a 10 day holiday for my daughters 18th birthday.  We didn’t even have our bags in Dubai.  They told us they didn’t have a hotel and to come back in 3 hours to the 15 hour queue.  Honestly you couldn’t make it up and when I asked an Emirates official why they couldn’t help to alleviate the situation, put on more staff and offer information etc the reply I received was threatening...’Madam, everyone is in the same situation,’. I will never fly Emirates again.  I understand there was a flood but to be treated so shockingly and to be left for 3 days in a country without a hotel or bags was abominable."
673,"I used points to upgrade myself on a red eye from Edinburgh to Dubai - and have previously found the service and the food to be quite good on Emirates First Class. Not this time around. Not only was the food bad, it was poorly prepared, served lukewarm and the crew clearly did not really care.Shrimps hard as rock and very dry, sinewy lamb masala. And yet another Emirates flight with a long wait for a bus to the terminal - in their own airport."
674,"I have traveled Business Class with Emirates for 8 years, and I remember the first time, which I enjoyed excellent service on-board , amazing plane, great lounges and customer service, if you needed them were knowledgeable and very helpful and polite.....Move to 2020 and if you ring customer service 5 times, you will get 5 different answers, if you can understand them. The planes are grubby, the service on-board can sometimes be poor and their lounges are now generally poor in comparison to competitors.Emirates need to up their game or they will lose their most loyal passengers."
675,"I wanted to share my Emirates experience to warn everyone how bad it is. Our outbound was delayed from Newark and I was concerned on our entire flight that we would miss our connection in Dubai.The host assured me Emirates had the ability to hold any flight for up to one hour, and that we would make our connection. We arrived only to find we had missed our connection by a mere 20 minutes. We were devastated, as this was the only flight out that day, and were told we would have to spend 24 hours in Dubai.There was no one on the ground to help us, so we made our own way to customer service. The staff were rude and completely unapologetic that we would lose 24hrs from our vacation - the only time I have to see my family every year. They just told us to go to the hotel and didn't give us any guidance as to how to get our baggage, or even where our baggage would end up. The flight they rebooked us on allocated us seats at the back of the plane, as if losing 24hrs wasn't punishment enough. We then spent a further 3 hours at the airport, trying to get our seats moved and also secure our baggage.Even more concerning than all of this, there was ZERO guidance around what it meant to enter the UAE and what we should be careful of medication-wise. When we went through customs to enter Dubai, they searched my bag and started questioning myself and my husband for sleep medication I had with me. It was incredibly disturbing and made even worse later finding out my husband had both Benedryl and pseudoephedrine - two over the counter drugs that are JAILABLE OFFENSES IN THE UAE without a prescription! This is a complete lack of duty of care by Emirates. What went from a delay, to losing a day off our trip, could have resulted in us both being imprisoned. This is absolutely disgusting behavior and not what I expect of what is said to be a 'premium' airline.The above, and the complete lack of empathy I received from Emirates staff has been a completely awful experience. Emirates should be ashamed you are charging the fees you charge for this type of treatment."
676,"The worse customer service ever in Delhi .i was offloaded as had dry coconuts in my suitcase and they assured me the plane will wait for me ,by the time they took me down to remove the stuff from the suitcase they closed the door even though I was there .they couldn’t care less and left me stranded in Delhi to book my own flight back and go and find a hotel at 1am .this was so dangerous for a lady .they were most unhelpful and charged me twice for no fault of mine .such such bad customer service .i expect a response to this complaint"
677,"First time flying alone and with Emirates - was due to fly back from South Africa to UK connecting in Dubai but due to delays with first flight from storm in Dubai I missed connecting flight. Was told before I left SA that I would already have been put on a later flight and just have to go to desk when I land in Dubai. Waited in a queue for 14 hours(!) as there were only two people behind the desk trying to help the 3000 passengers (I overheard one of them saying) needing to be redirected. Managed to get put on a flight the next day but had to sleep in the airport as they couldn't arrange a hotel for me. 23 hours in total spent stuck in Dubai! 2 hours after finally landing in UK I find out my bags are still in Dubai, and then hear from a second person that they are in UK but have gone to a different airport. Utterly disgusted with the entire experience and not what I would expect from Emirates."
678,They have the worst frequent flyer program I’ve ever used. Miles upgrades are almost never available.  And they don’t even have an availability Calendar on their website. You have to phone them to ask if upgrades available which is costly and time consuming.    And sometimes if you book  flight and phone back to upgrade and they are no longer available only a few hours later .  Horrible.
679,Booked my holiday in advance to try to secure best price as advertised 40%off only to find in the months before departure the price had come down by £1300!I know they work on a live system but £1300 really!!! I am travelling for my 40th so a special occasion which has been totally ruined. Called Emirates and they were not bothered at all. Won't ever use again.
680,Well for an airline its not a bad option especially if you want to visit dubai as part of your trip as well. But here is a catch i travelled first back in 2015 when i had a connection of 22 hours between flights but despite the fact emirates says they will provide complimentary dubai connect service where u can exit airport and will be provided hotel room and meal as part of it. But i was denied back than saying my ticket does not qualify even when i paid whatever the emirates website quoted me for. This time again on a long haul with family taking same flight been told same thing again. I have really no idea why they cant just say to buy business or first class to avail this service as we will not fulfill our written promise of website of giving same thing to economy class passengers. Will definitely avoid emirates from now on lesson learnt
681,"Well Emirates have lost themselves a frequent customer! Today at Auckland airport my husband and I spent half an hour with an awful person at check in who made us repack all of our bags in front of everyone simply because ONE of our hand luggage bags was 2kgs over weight. Both hold bags were under weight. I said we will simply pay a fine if necessary to avoid the stress but she said there is no fee for an overweight carry-on bag (so very unsure as to why she tried to make our life hell except to hold up the whole queue).I fly Emirates for both business and personal frequently (and thus my team and my family fly with them frequently too). The horrendous and stressful experience I have had today will mean I won’t fly with Emirates again (post my Bali trip I have next month with them). Unfortunately for Emirates, I work for a large corporate too and when I travel for business I will ensure my team never fly Emirates as well."
682,"Same que as the previous guy. Non existent customer service in Dubai airport. Rude staff, I was told all the hotels were booked up. I had to sleep rough in the airport for 20 hours, on top of a 3 hour delay from an earlier flight. The worst service I have ever experienced. Don’t fly with emirates. Oh and the inflight food is disgusting."
683,"First time flying with Emirates and it is an absolute joke! The staff aren't helpful. We have been waiting in a que for 13 hours to be told that we can get on a flight, but can't get our boarding passes as we can't get to the desk. They haven't informed any customers about what is happening. All Emirates care about is money by the looks of it! Will never ever fly with them again"
684,Would give them a zero. Shockingly bad!!Contacted then for reassurance as my flight is due to fly over Iraq/Iran. Most airlines are diverting flights but not Emirates. They have clearly been given a script 'we are in contact with the government and safety is out priority' which is just repeated over and over. Which is funny because every other airline is doing the safe thing and diverting. Originally told they had waived cancellation fees due to the situation only to speak to the next person and be advised that was bull. Unable to deviate from the script in anyway and actually provide clear answers. Wont be flying with them again! Pick an airline that gives one about its customers.
685,"1. Economy toilets disgusting - urine all over floor, bins completely full for basically the whole journey.2. Flight delayed, forced to rearrange flight. The airline put you up in the Capthorn Hotel. I would recommend you burden the cost yourself and don't stay there (let alone the 'free' meals they offer).Suitcase not given to passengers so had to wait a whole day without belongings. 3. Customer service completely uninterested, did not reveal to me they could have put me on another airline to avoid missing a business meeting"
686,"We have flown with Emirates for many years and have always found them to be good. We have booked to fly with them again in a few weeks' time, and when I checked the cabin baggage allowance, I was shocked -  7 kg , and only 1 bag allowed.These are new rules,so handbags etc., have to be put inside the trolley. This is lower than Easyjet and Ryanair ! It is difficult going away for a long holiday with valuables which cannot be put in the hold luggage ( i.e. cameras, binoculars, laptop). Emirates must know this, as they charge hefty fees for overweight cabin and hand luggage So, this is all about profits, and not the customer.If we also experience bad service, as many others have said in their reviews, we will never book with Emirates again."
687,"Interesting to read reviews about the poor service provided the Emirates. Can only agree.Had booked a flight from Perth to Copenhagen at New years eve, obviously with too high expectations. - The delay of 40 min from Dubai was met by no info nor appologize. - Crew members were openly eating/drinking, chatting, bored ... seemed tired. Have never ever experienced anything like that.Other delays, Dubai-Perth - no info."
688,"I have been flying Business Class with Emirates to and from Australia regularly for over six years and have been very happy with the cost and quality until recently. Suddenly on the last two trips delays, equipment failures and poor service have become common place. This week I wanted to move a journey back to the U.K in May forward a few weeks to coincide with my wife. Emirates wanted to charge me an extra £1750 despite having plenty of availability on the chosen flight. Having already paid a not inconsiderable sum for the original business class flight I thought this completely unjustified so complained to Emirates. The response was very unsympathetic stating that it is within their flight rules. Emirates fares have also noticeably increased and now other premium airlines such as Singapore Air compare favourably. So Emirates have now lost two of their longstanding and loyal customers and really don’t seem to care. If they continue in this vein there are in for major problems ahead."
689,"Terrible attitude for families, I travelled from Yorkshire to Manchester airport , checkin staff no interest, no option to upgrade to first and flight full of crew free loading and no where to be seen"
690,Bad food. Unfriendly service.
691,Worst flying experience ever.Flying business class with emirates is the same sa economy with qatar airways. Verry disappointing. The flight from bkk to phn I wassent even presented with the menu. The flight attenden asked me if I wanted the ceasersalat and I said yes please I never got it. When we landed and evry one stod up to leave the plane I went to the toilet. And rudly I was told to sit down again. On the way back to bkk I was not provided with the seat That I chose and insted I was provided with a wall seat. Don't use emirates business class pay more and go first class or save the money. And use economy.
692,"Our son needs medical food. We took enough with us for the whole journey of 10 days. It should be stored at room temperature. So not in the belly of the plane. They refused us, Only 5 bottles on board was excepted as handlugage."
693,I had a very bad experience at the counter when I asked about the long 10hrs stop over in Dubai and the option of providing the hotel room. The receptionist was so rude and not even helpful didn't even apologize for the inconvenience.
694,"SPOILED HOLIDAY! Will NEVER BUY A TICKET WITH EMIRATES, EVER AGAIN.* I finaly bought a ticket for my brother, 21 years to travel to Dubai for the first time by air. So i chose Emirates as the airline looked excellent. There were cheaper airlines like Kenya airways almost 2 times cheaper than Emirates. However i chose what i thought was the best airline. But no i was fooling myself. 14 August  2019 my brother boarded this Emirates from OR Tambo airport to Dubai. This was much awaited Holiday for my brother. The whole family had a happy farewell to my brother at the airport. It was a flight which was budgeted for 10 months. On arrival at the airport in Dubai same day, my brother was badly treated by the airport staff. The immigration contacted Emirates to change return date on the ticket to 15 August and never notified the passenger. This happened when the immigration said my brother s visa had a spelling mistake only in Arabic. It was not my brother who made the visa. It was the Agency there in Dubai which my brother had to contact to get them modify the error. When the visa was modified and error rectified, the immigration allowed my brother in. The problem came later when my brother wanted to return on the 3rd of November as on his ticket. His ticket date was altered by Emirates customer service through the immigration order. My brother was never informed both by Emirates and Immigration. News only came after from Emirates that the immigration s order was to deport my brother for such a simple error not made by my brother but the Agency which rectified the problem anyway. Both immigration and Emirates staff vey unproffessional to cause my brother to be stranded after all this money spent for this Holiday. When i contacted Emirates, they told me to contact the Agency i bought the ticket from and pay some more money to rectify the problem of this altered ticket. A problem they caused. The Agency i bought the ticket from in South Africa had nothing to do with cancelling passenger ticket for no reason. What foolish inconsiderate staff!!!. Spoiling customers Holiday. If i had bought a ticket through Kenya airways, would the Kenya airways staff had listerned to immigration at Dubai airport to cancel a customer ticket date but never notify the customer? I phoned the staff at Emirates about this, but all i was told was spend more money to get my brother back to South Africa.  Do not spoil your Holiday through Emirates. I used to travel with them before, of whom i am still a member but i will completely close all services with Emirates.I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO TRAVEL BY EMIRATES. the Staff are very inconsiderate and less brains. The immigration staff at Dubai also do not have proper knowledge of handling passengers coming. They treat them like criminals like they treated my brother from Johannesburg."
695,The business class cabin gave a feeling of Economy for flying A380 from from Toronto to Dubai
696,"This airline has progressively been going down the tubes and it has now hit the rock bottom. Appalling ground service at Durban airport. Staff determined to impose maximum inconvenience on passengers. I regret choosing Emirates, won't happen again!"
697,"The most horrible land crew service. Discrrminated passengers deal to their nationality or class fare, Pls don't take airline, never ever. Deal with complaint like a week or even longer than that, and now, seems like NOT responding. So, I don't know what's customer mean to this airline?? Selling tickets? After that, then no service? Or you will have service if you are from certain race or you are on business /first class,I am now developing fear of flying, that I may be treated badly by the airline staff in the future again. I wrote some reviews about my experience here before, this is a follow up.I was treated badly and unfairly in the Brimingham airport.  The crew talked to me very very rudely deal to my overweight luggage, like I was a criminal.  Like I did something very very wrong,, like they are the police, or the customer officers, that I was taking drugs, or something.They only weighted my luggage before boarding, but not the other passengers I believed they discriminated me, because of my race or my class fare.  I put compliant to the customer service, didn't reply my complaint accordingly.  But, only like giving me 'copy and paste' statement, I felt like Im talking to the air.  then the lady ""Sabrina Liu' , closed the case herself, this was what she said""I am unable to offer you any additional information concerning the handling of this matter. """" Therefore, I am unable to offer you any additional information concerning the handling of this matter."""" We will now consider this matter closed."" I opened a new complaint saying I was not satisfied by their response, more a week, still no reply.PLS DONT TAKT EMIRATES"
698,"Another great set of flights with Emirates, flying from London to Dubai with a 2 hour stop over & then on to Bangkok Then from Bangkok to Dubai (5 day stop), then back to London.  Flights were on time, had a great selection of in flight entertainment, food & service excellent as always.  In my opinion Emirates is one of the best airlines I've flown with, & I've flown with a lot of airlines."
699,"Disgusting service during booking and upgrading, Emirates send a lovely email prompting you to upgrade to business class, but then surprisingly when you try to make a payment there is a technical error on their website!! If it only happened once then I can understand but for it to occur multiple times on different bookings , it seems a bit suspicious!! When the technical error occurs the website prompts you to call them, but when you make the call, they cannot do anything, you can only do this through the website!! And the staff you speak to are an utter disgrace, brainless robots, all they can say is no i cannot help, it is literally like banging you head against a wall, number 1 airline I don’t think so, I flew with Qatar a few time now  and they seem to provide a much better seamless service, and the staff actually talk to you as apose to reading of a script!"
700,"A great airline to fly with and usually easy to book online. But until Airlines like this recognize that they have to clean up all the plastic waste produced on flights, like forcing passengers to use a new Single-use plastic cup each time they want a drink, instead of encouraging re-use, I can't award them more stars. There's really no excuse. Airlines have an extra responsibility in this regard given that their industry is part of the problem behind the Climate Emergency..."
701,Mumbai baggage check is such a hassleNot sure why they have such small aircrafts
702,"Had the pleasure of flying with Emirates from Bangkok to Dubai and then Dubai to Hamburg the 12/12/2019. (flight EK0059).The steward (Roulondo) and stewardesse (Tahany) servicing passagers around my seat were genuinely super friendly and smiling at all times. They made the flight really pleasant and made me feel welcome at all times.Super staff and good service, food on the flight were above my expectations as well.Will definitely choose Emirates again for my next long distance flight."
703,"If I can, I will put -100 to recommend this airline to anyone Same as other reviewers over here, bad experienceFirstly, their response to comments/complains is very very slow, takes them days to reply the issue.It is not my first time flying with Emirates, I was very pleased and liked it, I recommended it to my families and friends. BUT, this time was so disappointed. It totally put me off, my family and friends off.I felt like I was being picked on or even being discriminated. There are 2 weights at the gate. The staff asked me to put my luggage on the weight. They said my luggage was too heavy, they fined me. Of course, it was reasonable to be fined if someone 's luggage is over weight, HOWEVER, even my luggage was over weight, they talked to me in a very rude way, like I was a criminal. MOREOVER, they weight passengers selectively, I saw some other people carried more and bigger bags than me, they didnt ask them to weight their luggage. I was the only one who was asked to weight the luggage before boarding. I was wondering why was ONLY me."
704,"I have always had pretty good experiences flying with Emirates and if prices were even between all airlines, I would choose them every time. As far as airlines go, I believe this is a good one!"
705,"My wife, 3 year old daughter and I traveled in business class to Dubai and then returned back to Gatwick a week later. On our flight out to Dubai the service we received was comparable to a low cost airline. Firstly I’d like to point out that the business class section was less than half full. A crew member came to take my lunch order before take off but was told my first choice dish had run out! I later saw a crew member eating the dish I had wanted to order for my lunch on his knew crouched in the section between first and business class. I had no option but to order a chicken sandwich. Something I’d expect on a low cost airline and not business class. On several occasions it took over 20 minutes for my drink to arrive. My wife had finished her meal before mine even arrived and her fruit salad had a mouldy raspberry in it. There was no choice for my daughter meal and when I asked I was told that’s all we have. If I compare this to say Etihad it’s worlds apart. On Etihad we experienced fine dining food and service as we did on our other business class flights with other airlines. I must say I did not feel this was a business class service or food selection or presentation and that we were more of an inconvenience to the crew and I definitely did not feel I got value for my money. Also on arrival to Dubai we had to wait 20 minutes for our car and were handed a baby seat which was basically too small for our child. Initially they expected my 5 month pregnant wife to install this seat in the car. Absolutely shocking service.The only good part to the car service was in the UK were our driver arrived at our home on time and installed the correct car seat and was very helpful. Disappointed beyond words. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. I would rather fly Etihad and drive to Dubai."
706,Some of the emirates services need to be improved
707,"Hello,I was travelling from London Gatwick to Dubai on 29th November 2019. And I had the worst experience ever in my life, I have been travelling a lot but never came across such staff. To take the name loud, miss or mrs Monika & her team has been too rude to me. I never knew laptop bag and ladies purse are supposed to be weighted in the hand luggage only, I have been travelling around the world but never ever came across this rule. I don't know whats wrong with those people, I am a student and I was travelling alone, they harassed me a lot by asking me to pay for extra luggage which is hand bag and laptop , on me denial of such rules, they asked me to go out of the airport and also asked me if I will not go they will call security for it. they have insulted me, I and all my near ones will never opt for such stupid flight where such crew is appointed, each and every staff of emirates was laughing at me because I was trying to adjust my luggage, on someone helping me with it, they again came to me and talked as if I am a beggar. most pathetic staff ever, they took 187 pounds from me. I will share this post and soon like other stupid flights, emirates will close down soon. this refund of 187 has to be given to me , as I won't tolerate this injustice of the staff."
708,"worse experience ever, as a disabled traveller the staff on the flight was rude, abrupt and unhelpful. I waited over two hours for a drink!!! I had requested a special menu as I have a gut issue and allergies and was reassured by emirates that I would have a choice on the flight but didn't. the plane was dirty. I raised the issue with emirates back in September whilst on holiday and spent a day of my holiday being sent from one person to another by customer service and to date, there has still not been a response or formal apology. I'm so disappointed and would not use or recommend Emirates airline ever again!"
709,How can I receive my parcel. Am in Edo state
710,Worst experience ever - booked 'flex' ticket outbound and 'saver' ticket inbound. Now I want to push my outbound flight back one day - per Emirates this is not possible as return flight booked as 'saver'....... then what is the point of selling the combination 'Flex/Saver' if not given the opportunity to change the outbound flight - a service/flexibility I paid extra for  ???   This to me equals stealing my money - selling a service that does not exist or can not be used.I can NOT recommend this airline.
711,One word ‘atrocious’Cannot be bothered to write a review because I know they won’t get back.
712,"An employee named Oleta at the check in desk on our flight from Dubai to Phnom Penh  made me and my elderly mother wait 1 hour for no reason then coolly informed us our cases ""may go missing"" as such we didn't have any luggage for two days because of this vile unscrupulous hateful woman.So far no reparation has been made by Emirates for this woman's contemptible inexplicable behaviour. I Used to trust this airline implicitly after this horror story I'll never use them again, and advise others to do the same or you may fall victim to the despicable Oleta in Dubai. Thank you Emirates for the worst flight ever. After trying to get some help from their online form I havenot got anywhere. If you have any conscience at all show it, contact me, compensate me for your horrible employees degrading despicable/inexplicable behaviour. *0 stars for you Emirates, you have plumbed new depths with your employee Oleta."
713,"Just ok, was flying from DXB to Geneva"
714,Wonderful service. Especially to Christina Galea in Emirates Desk in Malta airport! She helped me with everything in the last minute. I have to say everything is possible with Emirates! Great food and staff is super helpful! I recommend a million times!
715,"Planes are good, but the cabin crew's hierarchy of service is: First class > Business class white > Economy white > Business class other people > Economy other people."
716,I am never flying with emirates ever again! I called in advanced to tell them I am pregnant and would like extra leg room but they told me I would have to go to the airport to book it. so I went 3 hours ahead of time and they told me i need to pay 200 pounds to get extra legroom. When I got onto the plane there were so many available seats. I sent an email to complain and they didnt even bother to write back to me. the standard has dropped to a point of no return. SO HOPELESS. I am never booking with emirates ever again.
717,"Poor customer service! When my parents checked in to Manchester Airport for there connecting flight, The lady who's sorting there tickets was frowning and very unprofessional, speaking to us like crap gosh horrible! it supposed to be a nice experience since Emirates is very well known airline but I'm wrong the employees need to get trained for proper customer service big time! especially this ill-mannered woman! No more Emirates for me next time."
718,"Although the connection desk staff were helpful in transferring my bag from T1 to T3, the transfer never actually took place even though I was told at the boarding gate that my bag was on the flight. I feel that Emirates and Dubai airport has grown out of control and this has had an effect on the customer experience. I have flown Emirates many times but I feel it is time to find a different carrier."
719,Asked if I could purchase seats with extra leg room at check in . Told no seats available with extra leg room and it they no longer charged for them. On the plane the seats in front had extra leg room and a couple who did not want to be seated near kids were told they could move to them . This left 2 seats which were empty and I asked if i could sit there. Having sat in the  seat 10mins later was told I had to move . Could have a seat with extra leg room but would have to pay extra 300 plus dirhams . This even though check in said no charge but no seats available. Ana said it was company policy and she’d rather have the seat empty than let someone sit in without paying the extra charge. This despite check in saying there was no charge. These people can’t lie straight in bed. Friends flew from Heathrow with BA for considerably less and I’m sure were not lied to .
720,"Our first time with emirates and after watching the advert was looking forward to trip to Maldives , have over the past years flown with many many airlines and can say the staff on Emirates are the worst, first 1.5hrs TV not working when I mentioned it to air steward she looked at me and said “oh!!”And just looked at me I asked if it would be looked at and she said “no can’t be fixed”  my call bell was not working either so my husband rang his and I said mine not working , she looked at my husband and said why did you ring then!!! Not once did they smile and we was made to feel like being nuisance and made me feel uncomfortable not looking forward to trip home . Your advert is false pretences"
721,"I will never fly with Emirates  again, worst customer service . worst movie collection. flight attendants just chatting with each other. they do not want to help passengers."
722,"I booked a flight ticket on September. The flight was from Dallas Texas to Addis Ababa Ethiopia. The flight had a lay over off 21 hours. I contacted Emirate customer service representative one days before my flight . The representative told me that I have to reserve the hotel before 24 hour of the flight time to have the hotel service during layover time. He helped me to get in to the hotel reservation website , believe me they have a hidden dedicated site for the hotel reservation, but I was 4 minute late. He told me that there is no way to reserve the hotel since the system is so rigid and inflexible. When I got to the Dubai airport, I talked to one of the Emirates representative. The representative told me that I have to pay $89. In addition, the service include only a hotel stay and I had to pay for my food. The other things don’t try to use Emirate if you are black. They are deep down racist. As I mentioned on the title there is three word which summarize Emirate service:- racism, Greed and rigidity. It don’t make any different whom ever you contact they are always right. They don’t know what is compromise means. No wonder they have 300% increase in there 2019 profit."
723,"We fly to Kathmandu with Emirates in October 2019. I have flown with them many times my preferred airline for years. The Gatwick to Dubia leg was excellent as ever great entertainment and food. At Dubai we found the next leg went from terminal F, a 15 minute bus ride away. This terminal is much more basic. The flight is NOT Emirates but Flydubai who seem to be a budget airline,  so limited food, poor legroom. Entertainment is paid for, not a problem as almost all the screens don't work. Drink is paid for apart from a glass of water, top up need to pay for it. So check who you fly with before booking."
724,Booked on emirates website early higher price later lower prices ripped off meRequest customer service very rude reply Book before make sure price
725,Really really bad.First no one tells you when the gate will open. At one stage one Emirates person said go 2 hours before the flight time but then there’s no one at the gate. They arrive slowly an hour before and behave rudely when asked. One guy is so rude it’s incredible. Dubai airport also deteriorated in terms of service. Having stores and shopping doesn’t make an airport better. What makes it good is how well they take care of passengers. The buggy people also consistently rude. I don’t want to travel in Emirates again so as to avoid Dubai airport.
726,"EMIRATES AIRLINE NO LONGER A WORLD CLASS AIRLINE MORE LIKE A BUDGET AIRLINEhere is my review of emirates from leaving Glasgow on 5/10/19 and also on my return flight from Bangkok on 19/10/19On arrival at Glasgow I check in my cases , check in staff no smile no hello just 1 word PASSPORTchecked in my case then she said to me HAND BAGGAGE She said SCALES NEED TO BE WEIGHED what a rude personArriving at airplane to board again no smile or hello from cabin crew was greeted with the words BOARDING PASS then told to turn left , no welcome on board no nothing Plane left Glasgow waited 2 hours yes 2 hours for the drinks trolley to come round only to be offered orange juice , water or Pepsi cola OUT OF A 2 ltr bottle with no cap on so the Pepsi was flat , no offer of a beer or wine or a spirit , it wasn’t even on the trolley , I asked for a vodka and coke , well she huffed and puffed and said something in her own language , she banged about the drawers in the trolley to find a vodka miniature but there was none on the trolley she said in English I WILL GET IT AND GET BACK TO YOU.

727,"Thumbs up to emirates' ground staffs at Dubai and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for their kind assistance and efficiency for letting me to get my US Visa all the way from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai on 01st October, 2019 and enable me to join my team in Dallas a day later with no cost incurred.  This marked my most unforgettable and memorable experience of flying.   Bravo Emirates"
728,Emirates is the worst airline ever. If any of you want to change your reservation within 24 hours expect a $300 penalty. They will not assist you in any way. They are overpriced and not accommodating. I have talked to several people within the airline and all of them were rude and not accommodating!
729,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. THESE PEOPLE ACT LIKE THEY ARE A SCHOOL'S PRINCIPALS NOT LIKE A SALES REPRESENTATIVES OR A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES. I WILL NEVER FLY ON EMIRATES AGAIN.
730,"as Gold Member and frequent flyer of Emirates airline, i encounter incident whereby attendant failed to coordinate or assist a passenger to put her luggage at overhead compartment, end up dropping 1 baggage on my head. When lodge a complaint, their officer just replied that their attendant is not required to assist passenger for luggage arrangement but at that moment it was a mess with that passenger since she failed to find suitable space hence anyhow squeezing her luggage, worse is there was a attendant just few steps away only looking at her and even only called other attendant to help but no on show up.other than this, i paid extra for extra legroom seat and end getting a seat with damaged screen and no power charging point. asked cabin supervisor about that and he only replied ""i can't do anything because this is old plane"" and not even offer me to change seat.there are still few other unpleasant experience with Emirates and their service is getting worse and worse, no wonder this year their ranking drop so much."
731,"Poor. Couldn’t check in line, when I contacted the airline support, told we had no booking and needed to buy new tickets. Blamed it on the travelagent, when I contacted agent they confirmed the booking, called airline back and they confirmed they had my booking and apologises. This led to a sleepless night for the family and my complaint was answered by a brief email to say thanks for highlighting the error!"
732,Reading the review here on EK prompted me to write my own. I don't understand why some people love this airline. To me this is a very nasty airline. I have flown several occasions and never liked it. Due to lowest fare for business. The economy class is pure cattle class treatment from the crew. Crew are young inexperienced looking and behaving and the seniors are arrogant and in their own world. Service is so poor it borders on rude and alarming. There seem to be no standards whatsoever. Meals are disgusting and when you ask for a drink the crew will just say no. I asked for OJ during breakfast service and was told no. And they are so busy going around clearing blankets from passengers before landing we have to dump it into their garbage looking bag then they dump the bags in the toilet! Attitude is so bad. Won't touch this airline if i can help it.
733,Very happy with Emirates. High service standards and always use them for my trips abroad. Keep up the good work..
734,"I feel i need to write this review due to the absolutely abysmal Customer service and standards of this airline company. My partner and i were travelling to the Maldives via Dubai with Emirates airlines and had a lovely journey on the way out. However, on the way back i decided to pay for extra legroom seating on both Emirates flights on a 777 from Male to Dubai at a cost of £70 each and then on the A380 from Dubai to Heathrow at a further cost of £80 each. When we got on board the A380 i noticed that the Extra legroom advertised was non existant on one of the seats due to the large Bulk head door sticking out almost 2 feet. At this point i asked one of the cabin crew if we could pay for a full upgrade to business class as i could not spend over 7 hours sat next to this bulkhead door. I am 6'3 and had less legroom than a standard seat. We knew there were business class seats available as were were told prior to the flights departure. but the Cabin crew member we spoke to told us ""No Way"" when asked to pay for an upgrade. and told to get a refund once we landed. What i found very distressing however was that an hour before landing, One of the cabin crew decided it was a good idea to place 2 Bin liners of used head rests leaned up against the fire exit door until the point of landing when i had told him it was a fire hazard and he moved them into one of the toilets!!  I have since been denied a refund on the seat. and will be taking this matter to the small claims court."
735,Emirates is getting worse for allowing young children including babies into Business Class. Why are we paying huge amounts for a seat to have a disrupted and noisy flight?
736,"Flew Emirates for the first time - was looking forward to the flight after hearing so much about them. What a let down. Flight from HK to Dubai - toilet was literally overflowing. The floor in the toilet was awash with urine which was spilling out into the galley area. Nothing was done about it - the crew couldn't care less. Then my next leg from Dubai to Paris - handbasin in bathroom had no water - so no washing of hands after using the toilet. Thankfully I always take hand sanitiser. Advised the crew about this - again couldn't care less.The planes are tired, old and worn. The cabin crew are tired, old and worn plus rude. We passengers were an inconvenience to them.I saw passengers getting wet from a leak in a bulkhead - again nothing was done.To top it off, I got an email stating I was chosen for a free lounge access on my return flight from Dubai to Hong Kong - 20 mins after the email was sent, I clicked on to accept this offer only to find out it was no longer available. 20 mins! Never again. I have written to Emirates via their on-line complaints page. Will see if they even bother to answer."
737,"On 8 Oct I called the customer service number 886 2 77450420. I opted for the Chinese language option. Upon connected, a guy by the name of Lucas (Lee) answered the phone. As I was walking and talking at the same time, a gust of wind was blowing. Lucas impatiently said he cannot heard me. His attitude is terrible (and that is an understatement), so I asked to speak to his supervisor but to my surprise, Lucas refused to pass the phone to his supervisor and after repeating myself 3 times asking to speak to his supervisor, Lucas refused and told me he will NOT transfer me and ask me to call again. WTH!!! I did not know CS can refuse to transfer the call and ASK ME TO CALL AGAIN and hang up!So I called again and another agent Mini (or Mimi) pick up the phone and after telling her I would like to speak, not sure if they are trying to shield their members but again, they refuse to pass me to their supervisor. It is only after I insisted and told them I am writing to their company that I finally get to speak to a Mr Chen (who told me he was the duty manager)Seriously, if that is the standard of Emirates CS, I cannot imagine what the onboard services will be. And this is my first time flying with Emirates and will also be my last time. You can keep the points, I don't deserve this type of attitude from your CS.And I was their first class customer. Can imagine how they treat the economy clasd"
738,"I had the best experience with Emirates airline. Firstly, on the flight to Dubai the staff saw that me and my friend who i was travelling with were seated separately and changed our seats so that we could sit together. On they way back from Dubai Flight EK605 i didn't feel really well on the flight. One of the attendants Scott was absolutely amazing and really took the time to take care of me, he went out of his way to ensure that I was feeling better. Scott is definitely an Asset to the team!! I would defo use this airline again!!"
739,"Terribly poor customer service, take days to reply and when they finally do it’s with lame excuses or options that cost you more money and increases Emirates profits.They quite happy to let a 82 year old lady that needs constant care alone at airports rather than let her carer take care of her unless he paid administration charges of £500 plus upgrade charges just to get lounges access!!"
740,"I strongly recommend NOT to use Emirates. Customer Service is really poor: aircraft crew is consistently unfriendly and unhelpful.In two out four flights TV set and/or headphones were not working appropriately. Two out of four flights the aircraft was not really clean and I could notice previous flight food remainings - e.g chocolates smarties. In Economy the seat is as spacious as in a low cost airline.At the airport, I asked for an aisle if possible, the assistant told me that ‘he would do what he could’. He assigned me a seat in the middle of the row; to discover when I arrive to the aircraft, that there were several seats on the aisle free. So not only he didn’t help, he lied too.To get your food and drinks you need to pay full attention of when is coming,  otherwise you miss your opportunity for the next 4 hours. They will not ask you, just pass by, and if you are with your headphones on, you will miss it. Uninspired, unfriendly customer service in a aircraft that feels hostile. No one smiles, any request is completely ignored. If going in a long trip, Emirates is not worth the money. Profoundly bad experience. British Airways or Singaporean airlines much better choice. I would avoid this airline whenever possible, the price is very high for providing an awful customer service and an aircraft that feels less confortable than a coach."
741,"Worst airline I have ever flown with. We travelled to Colombo, Sri lanka as a large family.  The crew and airport staff are rude, miserable and obviously hate their job.My Mum is elderly and accidentally left her essential medication on the flight when we landed in Dubai.... as soon as we realised after leaving the plane I asked someone to get it.... They said NO !!!!!! I complained to Emirates and got fobbed off as usual.Bever ever will I fly with you again !!!!!"
742,"Si inizia con il volo da Nizza a Dubai con un ora e mezza di ritardo.Ritorno volo Tokyo Haneda - Dubai, aereomibile vecchio e posti logori, sedili duri.Il bello avviene al ritorno Tratta Dubai - Nizza volo del 27/09/19, aereo semivuoto, personale femminile che accerchia cliente maschile facendo un sacco di foto e autografi, senza dare nessuna attenzione agli altri clienti. Non è finita qui, ai 3/4 dei passeggeri è stata fornita la colazione , dopo ben 50 minuti una Hostess avverte le colleghe responsabili di servire quei passeggeri. E dopo più di un'ora veniamo serviti. Rimaniamo senza parole. It starts with a flight from Nice to Dubai with an hour and a half delay. Return flight Tokyo Haneda - Dubai, old airliner and worn seats, hard seats. The nice thing is when you return Tratta Dubai - Nice flight on 09/27/19, half-empty plane, female staff that rings male customer doing lots of photos and autographs, without giving any attention to other customers.  It's not over here, breakfast has been provided to 3/4 of the passengers, after 50 minutes a Hostess warns the colleagues responsible to serve those passengers.  And after more than an hour we are served.  We remain speechless."
743,"I initially posted a complaint on here and changed my review because Emirates did everything to help me solve the mess they made but maybe I should have waited to return! I travelled to Dubai with three passengers on 26.09.19. Our chauffeur drive was originally booked for 7am but I changed it on the system for it to arrive at 6.30am and notified the chauffeur booking company accordingly. In the morning of travel, one car turned up at 6.45am and the other at 7.05am with me having to ring up the company and chase them! We finally arrived at the airport. Our experience on business class was good apart from one passengers seat that was broken and would jolt when putting it in the reclining position (seat 23K) My family member was moved to another seat. We were booked into the Hyatt Regency and we took access to the business lounge due to the convenience of using the facilities for work purposes. On three occasions the staff were rude to us. One staff shut the door on our faces and whilst another one questioned why we were there. They seemed to give preference to local customers and had no sense of customer service. On the way back we were travelling economy. We requested at check in to upgrade to business class and we were told the flight was finalised and it was only a option to upgrade on flight and the cost would be £500-£550 which seemed sensible. On flight we were told that the upgrade is £1100 which was ridiculous bearing in mind we had no chauffeur drive or access to lounge. We decided to continue with economy and what a class difference! The seats were tatty and ripped, the food was terrible and the staff were so unhelpful and unprofessional. I was lucky enough to review both classes but I didn’t expect to be treated so badly in economy as if I didn’t exist! I have traveled economy with other airlines and the service is no where near as bad as this! Emirates need to focus on providing customer care to ALL passengers. We live in a country where there is equality and for Emirates not to even maintain economy class is a negative reputation for the company. I now can confidently say I will not fly Emirates again. I have heard that Qatar is a better option and not even as expensive as Emirates. I will definitely pick a airline where I’m treated as a human and not a number."
744,"I flew with Emirates on the 26/08/2019 to India. I booked through Opodo. Everything went fine until I got to the airport and it transpired that Opodo had provided incorrect information about luggage weights for Emirates. I was 3kg over the allocated weight for cabin luggage and so Emirates charged me an extortionate fee. Emirates asked me to provide evidence that I had been informed of the wrong details. When I did they promptly ignored it and said I needed to take it up with the agent Opodo.I know the fault lies principally with Opodo, and I raised a complaint with them, however, I am unclear why Emirates would ask for evidence of being provided with incorrect information when they had no intention of acting on it in any way. I have been penalised as a direct result of Opodo and Emirates not having or providing corresponding information and each in effect passing responsibility to the other. Opodo act as an agent for Emirates and should have had the correct information - however, some level of responsibility lies with Emirates, either ensure your agents represent you correctly or don't let them represent you.Additionally, the way Emirates staff dealt with this matter was unprofessional, both at the airport and subsequently when I made a complaint. I spoke to the manager on charge at Birmingham airport, Ian Grovcott, and told him I had been informed 10kg when I purchased my tickets through Opodo. He replied that ""Emirates policy is 7kg"". I replied that I understood but that did not change that I was provided with incorrect information at the time of purchasing my tickets. Discussion continued for all of three minutes with Mr Grovcott repeating the same phrase two or three more times and not offering any other information or means of resolving the issue. At this point Mr Grovcott told me I was talking over him, which is the case because he was simply repeating the same phrase and I had already clearly stated that I had understood it, and he walked away. I found the manager's manner utterly unprofessional. He gave me all of three minutes at the baggage desk even through there was no one else waiting at the time (one other customer was been served by another member of staff). He implied that I was being rude and then in effect told me I was being rude for talking over him. He clearly noted I was angry about the charge, this was the case because once again I felt I was being penalised when I had been told the wrong information, yet his manner of dealing with this was to repeat the same phrase over and over again - an action that will only aggravate customers.A month later the official response from Emirates to my complaint simply parroted back to me details I had mentioned in the complaint (copied and pasted), and repeated ""Emirates policy is 7kg"" along with  ""please rest assured that our staff were merely following operational procedures and did not intend to appear uncooperative"". This seems to correspond with previous complaints I can see on Trustpilot that Emirates simply reply to complaints without acting on them."
745,"Having said we'd  never fly Emirate again we find ourselves leaving a cruise in Dubai on  9th November and having to fly Emirates to Glasgow same day. Not expecting an improvement in service after the findings of my previous review but either way I'll post an update.Update. Good points -flight left on time, that's it.Bad points- no refreshments offered until well into the flight, when rewuested was told ""You'll get some when the food comes round. Food trolley came out and started at the front ( We were in row26 on either side of the aisle) another trolley came out and stopped at our row, they asked my wife what she wanted -beef or chicken, served her and the person next to her then continued on their way down the plane. Eventually the 1st trolley arrived at my seat whereupon I was informed only chicken left but this wasn't a problem as I wanted chicken anyway. Stewardess then left me a tray and said she would bring the chicken presently. She arrived stating no chicken left only beef. I stated no thanks and that I would each the other items on the tray. She said she would bring me additional crackers and cheese which she did then 10 minutes later arrived at my seat with a chicken dish stating it was the last one on the plane and I would have to have it. I tried it and basically it wasn't worth the hassle. Lots of food went back so it must wasn't just me whoho thought it wad bad.No more Emirates for me, if I find myself in Dubai again then I'll transfer to Abu Dhabi and fly Etihad."
746,"I recently flew with Emirates business long haul. Our baggage arrived at Heathrow terminal soaking wet through and though, as well as damaged! Massively disappointed and will not be flying with Emirates again considering the amount me and my girlfriend paid for our business class flights. I’ve flown with Etihad, Sri Lanka Airlines, BA, and even AirAsia but never have I had baggage arrive to me soaking wet and a brand new surfboard damaged, even with a new bag packaged with 15mm of padding top and bottom.I find this almost insulting that Emirates can treat business class passengers in such low disregard, considering the cost of the airfare is almost 4 times as much. What good is a flat bed if your luggage arrives in such a way? I would hate to think what state my baggage would of arrived in had I flown economy!"
747,"Hi,  the customer support experience was great and precise. I wish emirates have more leniency for people who miss their flight by 20 min. It's not every one's intention to miss it. I was charges a fee of 500 aed as a penalty plus additional for available seats.  Mr m. Salman saed from emirates booking desk at Islamabad international airport really assisted and guided me to the best possible way and it customer service like this we all need. Besides the penalty I was very happy with how things were handled and how I was kindly treated."
748,"Unable to change flights with Emirates as booked via Expedia.com (avoid)'..Expedia want to charge £1800.00 to change flights or if I cancel 2 I will lose the 3rd?. Emirates are not interested at all despite several calls and several e mails, they just pass the buck.Reason for change due to very short connection time at Dubai which I didn't know when booked with Expedia,and now I have just read( 'Becky's) bad review of Emirates which highlights my fears of missing a plane and baggage getting lost..(Thank you Becky).So avoid Emirates and book via another credible airline which I will do in the future.Amazing how with today's technology and with just a few clicks on a pc no one can assist with the simplicity of changing a flight'..Why?, because they have your money and can resell your seats...It seems greed far outways customer service...."
749,"I have flown with Emirates many times in the past, but it is evident they have been going downhill lately.My recent flight to Dubai arrived late, giving us little time to transfer onto our Singapore flight. Luckily we caught it on time, but little did we know that Emirates had rescheduled us onto a later flight. They thought the best way to communicate this to us was by emailing my father whilst he was on an aeroplane with no internet access and obviously no time to check his emails whilst running to the gate to catch our connecting flight. Nobody told us personally that we had been rescheduled and nobody stopped us from boarding the incorrect aeroplane. In fact, we did not know we got on the wrong plane until my father finally had internet access in the Airbnb.Now onto the even bigger issue that the above lead to. They left all our luggage in Dubai since we boarded the incorrect flight. We filled in a report and was told our luggage would be delivered later that night. Three suitcases were delivered, except mine which was found in Dubai on that night. My father contacted Emirates multiple times, costing him $2 per minute, being put on hold a lot, only to hear the same sentence repeated - ""it will be on the next flight to Singapore"". He told them how urgent the suitcase was because it contains my medication, I also contacted Emirates multiple times on the Live Chat to express how urgent it was and they notified the baggage team how urgent it was. So, there are 3-4 Emirates flights from Dubai to Singapore everyday. It took them two days from finding my suitcase to actually putting it on a flight and sending it to me, offering no explanation whatsoever why it took them so long knowing how urgent my suitcase was. Everyday was filled with false hope as they kept saying it would be on the next flight over when in fact they don't even care about their loyal customers. It ruined my holiday in Singapore as we spent a lot of the time sitting in our Airbnb waiting for my suitcase to arrive since we barely got any updates and expected it to be on the next flight, which was a complete and utter lie.Another thing that has changed is their in-flight service. If you're sitting at the back of the plane, expect to have your food cold and your food/drinks given last. They also fill your tea cup 1/4 full, it's ridiculous!Fair to say, I will not be travelling with Emirates again and if they ever lose your baggage, don't expect them to be in any rush to get it back to you no matter how urgent it is."
750,"After 35 years of using them finally decided to leave them. Harassments in dubai with some extremely rude Emirates staff becames a routine. They forcefully take your cabin bag away even if it has your valuables, medicine and not locked and put them in holds. When complained in writing, they support their staff without investigating. Also removed facilities of booking seats in advance, reduced hold luggage weights etc and so many others. Became too complacent. I have introduced so many people to this airlines in the past but progressively getting worse service. Booked Qatar Airways for the first time in 35 years."
751,"I was excited to finally try the A380's landmark business class with Emirates. Needless to say the disinterested crew, dirty seats and broken ICE system made the flight painfully long. I'll stick to Qatar and Gulf Air..."
752,"The good:1. The A380 business class experience is good.2. Cabin crew are friendly.The bad:3. Ground staff are appalling. 4. No, ground staff are REALLY appalling: rude, arrogant, aloof...5. Customer service is shocking.6. Automatons. Robots. Computer says no brigade.Will be taking my business elsewhere in future."
753,"Flight EK3JF. DXB-LHR 16 April 2019 at 01.20 destination time. Seat xxx.   MXxxxxxx cabin crew whilst serving coffee sprayed coffee all over my head neck and shirt that I was wearing. After laughing at her mishap and realising that I was in pain and had been scolded by the hot coffee, she partially apologised but offered me paper napkins to clean up her mess. I asked her for a towel as my neck was burning but she said they were only for business class passengers and offered me raw ice from her ice bucket in paper napkins. Really?  Don’t your crew have first-aid training? After causing a scene in front of the other passengers I asked her again to get me a towel and she kept giving me paper napkins which were sticking to my neck, head and shoulders. I asked her to leave me alone as I got out my own wet wipes and cleaned myself up at this stage highly embarrassed and very self conscious. I asked here what shirt I was going to wear as my shirt was wet and covered in coffee.  About 15-20 minutes later she returned with a hot wet towel and a dry towel  and a pyjama top that I could put on. I must be honest that I was expecting her to say to go upstairs and have a shower and enjoy first or business class for the rest of the seven hour trip but nothing apart from asking me if I still wanted coffee!Appalling service from one of the most reputable and service oriented airlines in the world which is why I chose you. And I in turn end up with a scolded neck, laughter and an awful end to my three week trip to Australia to be best-man at my friends wedding in Sydney and visit friends and relatives in Melbourne and the Gold Coast.First complaint to Emirates and hey offered me a measly 15000 air miles.  I refused and then they stopped communicating with me.  I am so shocked by their treatment  and WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.  ￼￼￼￼￼￼"
754,"Bought return flights to Australia for my family and I to visit my brother and his family.This being the first time we are doing a long journey and with our son who was just under 2, it was a bit daunting.The Staff were really lovely, really kind and always came to see to us.  Food was decent and the drinks were good also. Selection of entertainment was great on the tv screens.The only bad thing is that, I had booked a child cabin, so my son could sleep in the cabin during the long flight.  But was told he was too big to fit in and he must come out.  When I checked online prior to booking, it said he was a suitable age.  We didn't have another seat for him so my wife and I had to share holding him.Other than that, great service. I have recommended to family and friends."
755,"I missed my flight because misguiding from one of your airport staff : on connection arrival the monitor showed my next flight on gate B6, so I went to this gate and waited. At 7:45AM a little before the boarding time on my ticket I asked the emirate staff at the b6 desk, if it was there for Phnom Penh, she answered clearly « yes it’s here, just wait we will board in few minutes. » When entering the gate at 8:20AM she checked my ticket and saw that she was wrong and send me to the Emirates counter instead of sending me to my gate b3! At the counter they refused to help me and ask me to pay one more ticket 287$ and fly 24h after. They refused to look for this lady who misguided me and of course she disappeared. It’s an absolute shame, I will never fly with this airline again."
756,"I’m only giving 5 stars as one of the air stewardes that was Roman, made my whole flight comfortable as possible for me. Gave me everything I wanted, and was very patient. The food on the way there was great, but going back was horrible. I feel like the kids had better meals than us."
757,"HiI have been through an incident with Emirates Airlines which I would like to share in order to see if anyone else been through the same experience and to warn others of that trapI've had two tickets from Cairo to Melbourne (1 for me , the other for my family on the same flight), both tickets were originally booked in Australia.On the day of online check in and while i was following the instructions to check in, i received a pop up promotional upgrade from economy to business class for one of the tickets for X AED, I couldn't upgrade it becuase the second ticket was not offered a similar promotion.few minutes later I received a similar promotion to the second ticket for Y AEDjust to confirm, I googled what is AED to confirm it is Emirates Dirham.I went through the payment procedure and I was shocked to see the credit card institute payment notification, same amount (X+Y) but in AUD!!!! which means triple the offered amount.I thought I might have confused both currencies but come on, I saw it twice for two different tickets and I googled AED!!!!IMMIDIATELY, I contacted the online customer service, Dubai office and physically visited the office at Cairo airport and it ended up with:- Every team is not responsible and doesn’t have any ability to do anything, as if every team is working for a different company.- One guy in Dubai office was very rude and was dealing with me as if I'm a thief who is trying to steal his own money.- I can’t change, or even cancel with a penalty , it is like a trap, if you fell in, GOTCHAAAA.- They are very slow to respond and at the end they have done absolutely nothing forcing me to use the trap ticket.- I indicated clearly that this amount is ok for me in AED but in AUD it will have severe impact on my yearly budget, and they were absolutely careless.I have done some online research and I figured out that I am not the only one who has fallen into this trap, even a very near friend of mine had the same incident while paying for an extra leg room seat which means it is a real trap!!!"
758,I book my flight with them back in July 19 but I had to cancel my flight for medical issue so they say will charge you $300 cancellation fee is that’s back in July 9 and so far they’ve been lying to me within 24 hour you’ll get your money but we are in August 22 I have not received my refund because they been lying to me
759,All the time they are broke luck and stole to many things. Today my sister back and find out they are broke the luck and store 2 perfumes and some stuff too and last month they stole with my mum too and also happened for my friends too.😡😡😡
760,"This was my first time with Emirates. All trips started and ended on the schduled time. But the airplanes need technical support, my head ""holder"" did  not work on one of the flights and on another where there only sound in left channel. The was a few ok movies, but most was very old."
761,"shockingly bad, rude and cutting corners to save money!Next time I’m looking at flights I’ll uncheck  Emirates flights, all I can say is absolutely shocking! Staff are rude, felt like a budget airline having to pay for seats. We paid £400 extra to sit together, we flew from Man- Dubai then Dubai-KL . First of all they tried to bump us off our paid seats, because I had a stick! Yet in the same cabin a lady with a wheelchair was pushed in? To business class! They used the excuse I needed to be able to climb the stairs?? Even though there were no stairs to the plane.no offer of help just rudeness! Drink service started 2 hours in and we were only allowed tea coffee, apple or orange juice. I asked for sprite and I was told no that’s with Dinner! Whilst they served one man 4 tiger beers. I’ve never been refused soft drinks on a plane before! The food was atrocious, and very limited drinks almost like they’ve been told not to give out too many drinks including soft drinks. Bizarre! On the second flight we sat on the tarmac for an hour in 32 degree heat at Dubai, no air con and no drinks for 2 hours 30 minutes. Not even water! We were sweating and felt dizzy and sick, Business class had cool air pumped in, whilst our cabin was 32 degrees, it took 3 hours to get to 26. We were all dehydrated and not happy, a lady behind us collapsed little was done for her, her husband asked for the cabin to be cooled but that only happened after take off! Obviously too expensive to cool down all cabins but business class was lovely and cool, they didn’t even move the collapsed lady back to cool her down. On the return,  service was worse and staff were aggressive, narky and damn right rude from the get go to everyone! I’m not sure what’s happened but Emirates is not the class airline we once flew, it’s badly downgraded by the food drinks or lack of and the extremely rude staff. They were bickering amongst themselves and really I can’t express how awful they were.My sister is gluten free so on both return flights she didn’t get a GF meal, despite putting the request in 5 months ago. Because she was GF they wouldn’t give her anything from the normal meals, except wait for it , in 15 hours 6 pieces of melon!!! When my sister asked on the second flight for something to be brought that was gf and plain like rice potato whatever, staff were rude and acted like it was her fault, they had no empathy and were snappy. seemed they were happy to let her starve! The flights cost us £950 each and I can confidently say I’d never fly with them again, just don’t bother! It’s gone from premium to budget, we fly around 5 times a year so there’s a minimum you know you should expect, I’d happily give it .1 of a star if I could! And that’s  because we got there and back!"
762,"Always had a more or less great flight with Emirates. Great airplanes, service and food. This is definitely my favourite airline by far."
763,"I have been flying with Emirates as the preferred long haul airline for over 10 years. The first time I raise an issue with them I see what a disgrace their customer service is.Flew back from Asia with Emirates and found my bag slashed upon arrival in the UK. Spent over one month in discussions with Emirates and their damaged luggage partners, K2 Global, to resolve the issue. I was passed between departments, ignored and told someone would contact me when no one did until I chased and chased. Ultimately told by Emirates, they cannot repair my bag, nor can they replace it and instead I should contact my insurance. It's a disgrace that they treat their loyal customers this way. Despite my long standing loyalty I now am seriously considering taking my money elsewhere. Emirates call themselves world class, they're not, they are no better than any of the low cost airlines and frankly they don't deserve any loyalty because it makes no difference to them."
764,"Very poor staff and Food,gone down hill,stopped using Emirates and was a silver Member."
765,"I have used Emirates for around 8 years, flying mainly Glasgow Dubai, but also Dubai Phuket and Dubai Hong Kong. I have had very few problems with them, although to change tickets etc is hard and expensive. The service has worsened a bit these last few years. When you compare their business class service to various US airlines, their price and service stands out as great value I have also used Qatar, Edinburgh to Doha and I was very impressed with them also"
766,"I am rating the airline prior to my flight 8/30/19.I am a disabled person seeking medical assistance in getting from the plane door to my seat. I filled out the medical information form, got it signed by the doctor and sent it off to the airline. Now I am calling each day trying to get necessary approvals for them to help me on my upcoming flight.Customer service is helpless, they are at the mercy of the Medical Assistance dept who are unreachable.They keep telling me that my onward journey from Dubai is on a code share airline - FlyDubai and that airline has to approve my medical condition before Emirates can do the same.I booked an Emirates flight in the USA and paid the airline. Emirates put me on a code share flight with FlyDubai. I filled ouf the medical form for Emirates airlines. How is it my responsibility to get approvals from FlyDubai and airline that does not do business in the USA or have a telephone number? Since Emirates is the primary airline they should get the necessary clearances from the other airline and get my special needs taken care of.The callous attitude of all the Emirates staff I have interacted with is shameful. I have called over 15 times in the past 4 weeks to get the situation taken care of but Emirates is not bothered and just refuses to help me. Makes my situation worse than it already was as I prepare to board the flight for medical treatment in India. Help Someone!!"
767,"Used the chat function, got someone called Marion. He/she was extremely rude and didn't know the policies and rules that are on their website itself.As soon as I mentioned my ticket was booked via an online agency, they became condescending.Shocking behaviour from such a big company!!!"
768,"I was due to fly Dubai with Emirates from Manchester on Friday 9 Aug. Train was delayed due to track obstruction, hence reached Manchester 1 hour late. We had 1 hour left for checking. I sprinted to the check-in desk leaving my wife and daughter to come as fast as they could. Obviously I was the last person to check in. I said my wife and daughter were doing their best to follow me. Phone connections between me and my wife was continuous. As they were on the lift, the Emirates officials said they could no longer wait. After 45 seconds they were in front of the desk. Despite our best supplication, they were still rigid with their decision. I sincerely believe my situation would have been considered if it was not Emirates. I had to re-book the flight with Etihad for Monday. We all family made a 3 hours long return journey by train again. We felt like they were not human but robot. Hope and pray other would not go thorough this situation."
769,"I am really disappointed from Emirates. As I booked a flight, I also booked the seats and paid for each one 30 euros. As a family I wanted to be sure we are all seated together. At the time of online check-in, my paid seats were not available anymore and I was assigned other seats. The new seats were together as well, but not the ones I paid for. I took the row were no one is behind us. At the check-in counter I requested my seats, but the reason was “carrier change”. But it was not a real change. It was before Boing 777 and changed to Boing 777 with no different interior as I could recognize. The Lady at the counter said I could request for refund. I did that, but it was denied with the argument I got a similar row with 4 seats. In the regulation it is clearly mentioned. It I am assigned any row, then no need to pay and book as seat?! I called Emirates and discussed it through, but with no success. This is a kind of making money.Therefore, I will try to avoid Emirates in future and not pay for seats. At other airlines you can still book a seat without paying! I just wanted to share with you my experience and everyone can decide for himself."
770,"A few weeks ago, I flew between LAX-BOM with family and it was a 22-hour nightmare for us. This was our first time with Emirates. We have traveled extensively with other airlines like Etihad, BA, and Lufthansa. But this time, unfortunately, we decided to buy a nightmare by paying way more than other good airlines.It all started with check-in baggage. The check-in counter crew demanded our passports without greeting or smile. In the past, some stuff was stolen from my bags so I asked them to put the zip ties on the locks. The counter lady reacted as if I asked her kidneys. After I insisted she threw some plastic zip ties at me and asked to put them on the locks with a red face.They flew one of the filthiest A380 on the planet. The plane looked pretty old with dirty bathrooms and broken seats. I requested the Hindu meal for my family (three of us) and the steward only got two of the meals. I asked him politely about my meals and his response was ""I only got two hands"". Later he came back and said he accidentally gave it to someone else and I have to eat whatever they have left. I later talked to the head of the crew about the incident and she apologized and promised me that she will take care of the next meal. Nothing happened except now ""The steward"" giving us angry looks every time he passes by. They only gave us two blankets and when I asked him for a blanket he (obviously) said that they don't have any blankets.TADA."
771,"Terrible customer service. I took a flight 3 weeks ago and discovered my bag was absolutely destroyed as it came on the luggage carousel. I immediately filed a complaint at K2 Global; however, soon learned that the compensation options were completely inadequate. I was advised to get in touch with Emirates directly, who on first contact seemed quite capable of resolving my issue. Here I am two weeks later, with no call back and no new bag. So, I gave Emirates another call this morning and was told they could give me a call back once they had a solution to my issue. I asked to have my case immediately escalated, yet discovered that the 'line is too busy' and I was unlikely to have my case investigated.Very irritating considering I am travelling again next week and have had to purchase a new bag. I'm also very surprised at the lack of customer service, considering i've never deemed Emirates a budget airline. Seriously, I've received better service from some low-tier Asian airlines and would consider booking with those over Emirates any time now. Very dissatisfied customer."
772,It's been 20 days we filled a complaint but they haven't done anything about it. Worst customer service given to us. We calling every day but they are not replying properly. They have cancelled our tickets for no reason. They've cancelled early seat selection twin seats without letting the passengers know about it and without even asking. Worst experience every with any airline. I am so shocked that such a good reputable airline have been doing this with the customers.
773,My suitcases built in lock mechanism had been broken and items out of my bag had been removed from my suitcase. I needed to provide original receipts of the items stolen. I just moved overseas and did not keep and store receipts for every item I have ever bought. How disappointing.
774,They got me to return my duty free saying its not within the allowed luggage allowance. Honestly this is a very poor experience from a customer point of view and in my years of travelling the first time I have experienced this with an airlines. The staff as well was pretty rude about it and showed no professionalism.be rest assured this will be my last flight with Emirates. Horrible experience before I even boarded the flight. And I almost think this was racist as it was an India bound flight and they wanted to make money off people.
775,"‪My worst flight ever today flying first class EK 721 dxb -nbi. Such a rude and scary Male flight attendant, literally keep fighting with me, shouting at me, rolling eyes,after landing even barred me from going to my seat back from business class( my kids were there) to pick my bag from first class till I had to explain myself for over a minute! Never had a more humiliating experience with Emirates. This is how first class passengers are treated ? How will you treat economy then? Always loved Emirates for their services, today impression all came crashing down! May be I was a single mother travelling without husband or may be he is a recovering alcoholic or someone overcoming divorce with anger issues. Whatever the reason was, it was such an ugly experience! I couldn’t believe myself as my first class even business class experiences always have so amazing and I travel every fortnight. This was honestly below the belt! At a point I was so scared of him , I thought he wanted to punch me!"
776,Very bad customer service. Twice my booking got cancelled after I booked expensive tickets without any reasons. Be aware: you might get a shock after you thought you would have made a check behind booking a specific ticket. The customer service behaves like a roboter that only can reply with standard phrases to you and actually doesn't help you at all.
777,"BEWARE - LACK OF EMPATHY OR CUSTOMER CAREThis company it is completely overrated, highly insensitive and with an attitude of limited care / no empathy for its customers over its desire to make money. I suffered a catastrophic heart attack necessitating an extended stay in hospital, surgery and as such an inability to travel on my booking dates.  Despite providing the company with enough notice of cancellation (over 2 months) to enable a resale of the flight seats - a refund or waiver was refused by the airline hiding behind something called the fare rules in its Ts&Cs. (Effectively the airline offers no refund for customers sickness/illnesses before a flight). This is a warning to all potential Emirates travellers to be aware of how it treats its customers and to read the company's  Ts&Cs. The Emirates customer service team did not seek to help resolve this situation and replied with stock/standard refusal responses. While I previously had a good impression of Emirates (based on their slick promotion and marketing ads) but will now seek alternative more customer care focused airlines and urge others to do the same.if i could award the airline minus points - i would do so. Totally terrible"
778,"On Friday 19th July my parents were returning from their holiday from India they had a flight from AHD to DXB and DXB to LND. During their connection flight from DXB to LND we had booked Asian Veg meals for them. This was not noted and also it was confirmed at the checking desk and the person that checked them is confirmed this was on the system. When the meals came around the flight attendant said they had not Veg Meals Available and only Chicken and Beef. This is very POOR SERVICE and this is NOT TOLERABLE, My mother and father was given a cheese sandwich in replace of a meal DO YOU THINK IS ENOUGH for a 65 and 66 year old???? is this how Elderly people are treated in the UAE and on the Emirates Airline???THIS SHOULD BE REPORTED TO HIGHER AUTHORITY and also REPORTED TO HUMAN RIGHTS.THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME, I TOO HAVE EXPERIENCED RUDENESS ON AIRLINE AND DUBAI AIRPORT. AND I REVOTED MY MEMBERSHIP AND REFUSE TO TRAVEL WITH EMIRATES @Emirates"
779,A great carrier but my last trip was a business class disaster and the worst handling ever in kuwait airport!!’
780,"Have flown Emirates several times between Asia and Europe, on both Business and First. Seats were comfortable, food and service fine. Never observed any of the kinds of things other reviewers complained about.What I don’t like is Dubai airport. It is so overgrown that on several occasions I had to take a 15-minute bus ride from the plane to the terminal. As for the main terminal, there are no moving walkways. If your gates are far apart you may be forced to walk 20-30 minutes through an interminable shopping area packed with passengers. The upper-floor Emirates Business Lounge is the same story - very very long corridors to walk through, food selections spread out and not interesting enough to compensate for the distance you had to move."
781,"I have all along been dying to fly with emirates Airlines actually i tried several times but i failed. I got a chance of recent when my relative came to pay a visit on me here in dubai. Now when i was browsing through the cheap tickets online, i landed on Emirates i was excited and decided to book it for my relative. Now on the day of flight, we reached an hour to the flight but we found big cues and there is no way you can by pass someone you have already found in the line so you have to wait for your turn to get served. We reached the counter and the check in lady told us we were late by 15 minutes. It was so hurting and they could not help apart from telling us to rebook the ticket of which the amount was even more than the initial cost of the ticket. very bad experience i dont think it will ever get off my heart"
782,"Recently returned from a long haul flight using Emirates Airlines (two flights each way). I've scored this as ""average"" (3 stars) because only one out of the four flights was excellent with first class passenger care as Emirates claims it has. Two out of the three remaining were ok and did the job but one flight in particular was poor in so much that I rarely saw a smile from any of the cabin crew and were at times quite rude and arrogant. Yes, I accept that there are difficult passengers to deal with but this attitude was completely uncalled for because some of us are actually nice and respectful to the cabin crew!, Also on the same flight there were not enough headphones available so couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment and when it came to serving meals I missed out on my menu preference because they ran out by the time they reached me. Surely a flight experience on the same carrier should be the same for all flights and not depending on who the cabin crew is. After all, aren't they all supposed to receive the same extensive training?"
783,"Most awful airline experience with total lack of respect for customers. Food choice and quality offered on the flight from Dubai to London Heathrow that not even a dog would like to eat. Disgusting, poor quality and total lack of choice. The stewardesses are rude, uncaring and totally ignoring customers needs. During the 7 hours flight I and my daughter were offered some ""dehydrated"" smelly, old and reheated strogonoff beef, and when we refused to accept it, the head stewardess informed us she had nothing else to offer. Insult to customers, shame on a ""reputable"" Emirati airlines."
784,The service was outstanding and very professional. I was 12 weeks pregnant and the cabin crew were very sympathetic and accomodating towards my morning sickness. I can't thank them enough for how they attended to my needs. I aim to fly with them in the future!
785,The staff were very helpful assisting myself and my wife to and from the plane. The journey was comfortable with plenty of legroom
786,"A flight from Katmandu to Dubai was delayed by 2.5 hours. So we missed the flight from Dubai to Edinburgh. All we need is a letter/certificate to present to our insurance company stating the delay. After weeks on, finally a reply they had no record of our delay because it was a flydubai flight.  But on arrival Emirates said they couldn't get us back to Glasgow for 2 days. They would put us up in the airport hotel and give us food vouchers. Okay a chance to look at Dubai - oh no. We can't let you have access to your luggage and go out to see Dubai. You have to stay in the hotel for 2 days with only the things in your hand luggage. So after considerable hassle 2 hours later managed to get one stage up in management we got a flight to Gatwick next day. So Emirates have no record of this? I don't believe it. We flew from Gatwick to Glasgow on Easy Jet at our own expense but our insurance company will cover. All we need is a communication stating the delay and change in flight. Emirates take weeks to reply to what should be a simple formality."
787,Booked a ticket online direct with Emirates.  Realized I made a spelling mistake and called Emirates 5 mins after making the booking. They charged me $44 to change a S to a Z ... this is outrageous and disgusting.   $44 to change a incorrect spelling
788,"Very disappointed with the flight to and from Cape Town to Dubai. The plane is old and service poor. Comparing it to dubai to istanbul where the planes were new and staff excellent. If ever I travel overseas again Emirates will be my last choice. In December 2017, I experienced the same. I emailed them and have never received a response. Thought it was going to better this time but was hugely disappointed."
789,"I travelled from india to united states via dubai in month of June,2019 with my one year kid. Never had such worst experience with the cabin crew especially in long flight. My baby spilled a glass of water in the bassinet by mistake and when I called the hostess for help, she just replied bassinet is meant to sleep and she gave me a bunch of paper towel and said clean it yourself. Its not only with me when an old lady(65years or above) went to the crew asking for water, she replied she ll finish her duties and bring her water and she never brought. They did not help even a bit to the passengers. And they just made passengers to get fear of even calling them for help. Very worst experience."
790,"Travel experience NIGHTMARE because of Emirates. There was nobody, and still is nobody there to help us. Would not recommend this airline to friends or family."
791,They cancelled my flight from Dubai to Khartoum. And when I called the customer to get a refund  for my tickets the staff hang the phone on me . i have not get a refund for my tickets
792,"I had a wonderful flight. I have only good experiences with Emirates, whom I have flown with on 5 occasions. If I can fly Emirates, I will fly Emirates. Even though they are a bit more expensive than the other airlines, their excellent on-flight service makes up for the higher cost. The reason for my one-star review is that I have had to cancel a flight with a Flex ticket, which supposedly is refundable, I have, however, not received a full refund yet. This is frustrating, because I have contacted Emirates on three occasions during the past 90 days to get this problem resolved. I normally do not consider myself a bad-mannered-costumer, but this is deeply upsetting. I wonder if I will ever get my money back."
793,"Miserable flight attendants. Awful treatment of economy passengers. Economy class food was terrible.  The on board staff were miserable and extremely unhelpful to economy passengers as I observed the staff closely. Almost as if they didn't want to attend to economy passengers needs.  One economy passenger didn't get his food because staff claimed that they had ran out lol. Awful airline.  I only used this airline because my favourite airline British airways had bumped up their prices.  Also my flight actually had two stops and not the one stop that I paid for as advertised online. Flight was EK004, EK713, EK714, and EK029 (return)."
794,"just bought a business class ticket from one emirates partner travel agents only to find that the ticket has been stripprd of all the perksie no pre bookable seat no air miles no car to the airport and no acccess to the business class lounge ,At no time during the booking process was i informed that this was not a standard business class ticket would not have booked if i had known Emirates and there business partner travel agents are secretly selling these tickets without telling the customer that the usual perks have been stipped out  Thats FRAUD come on Tim clarke surly you are better than deceiving your loyal customers!"
795,"Flew business class to Dubai from London returnChauffeur service in Dubai is chaos. Stood nearly an hour in 40 degrees waiting. Gluten free food served wasn’t fit for my dog, while I watched others eating much tastier looking food ( which with the bread removed and a tiny bit of thought was gluten free anyway!)Cabin staff were generally brusque (rude) Definitely would not spend my hard earned cash with them again."
796,"Been a true client to this airline for 12 years now but all I've had from them is crap. This is my last trip and I will never again travel with them. The service levels are so crap. Most of the food is not editable.. They don't believe in cleaning or maintenance.. We had to clean as we go on each flight as the entertainment screens and seats were so dirty.. In terms of maintenance, we had loads of water leak from overhead at take off and landing and made things completely wet. The cabin crew tend to think that the water leakage was normal behaviour as we were sat behind the galley. Guess they hire Bob the builder to look after their maintenance, Who does not have a clue. To top it all off, I got back from my trip to Kuala Lumpur and found my checked in baggage locks and zips were broken into and all my stuff rummaged through and pulled out and packaging ripped for certain items and dumped back into the suitcase. Unbelievable, not sure who gave them the authority to break into my baggage without my consent. There is also a security risk to allow my baggage to travel outaise my view completely open. Anyone could have inserted illegal or dangerous goods into my baggage which this airline does not seem to take serious or care about.As we were travelling with a baby for the first time, there was a lot of stress and I managed to forget a duty free bag with alcohol at security in Dubai while changing flights, we realised after boarding the next flight and was not allowed to go back out to retrive the bag. They asked me to contact their lost and found and collect on my way back. When I contacted them at Dubai on my way back I was advised that they only hold alcohol for 24 hours and then dispose off.. Alcohol is normally years old? 24 hours? Who normally goes on a 24 hour holiday to return back that quick?I have personally email CEO Tim Clark in relation to the Mickey Mouse operation he operates.. Hope that he does not fobs me off to someone else like they did with my last complaint..I will never be traveling by them ever again.. Good bye Emirates.."
797,AVOID THERE WEBSITE AT ALL COSTS IF YOU NEED A VISAAn airline that takes NO responsibility for it's own website links for it's visa application service and then fobs you of with an appalling customer service response. Ruined my holiday before it had even started with the stress and problems incurred with this airline's website.
798,"Frequently, hear and read about bad service by this airline. But never trust what you hear until try it by yourself. Yes, two months ago I have choosen to fly with Emirates -Economy class. Positive: 1. A380 is perfect to fly with very convenience cabin.Negative: 1. Flight attendant has no service mind compare to other long distance airlines. 2. WIFi connected but not able to use any browser, chat messages etc. 3. No fruit & juice or drink service after meal time (only if you to station and request for).4. No flight attendant service after press the service button.If other long distance airlines offer similar price, Definitely select them first. Nowaday, many ailines offer A380."
799,"We travel to Bali twice a year business class previously used Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines.  Last  2 occasions tried Emirates being marginally cheaper.  BAD decision Trip 1. 45 Minute business class check-in rude check-in staff at Heathrow. Food and service on board poor.Trip 2. Flight missed take off slot because ground / boarding staff inefficient so 40 minutes late take off therefore missed Emirates flight from Dubai to Bali by 20 minutes, so had to wait 24 hours for next flight, Food and on board service very average. To cap it all they are refusing EU compensation and we have had to refer to Airline Dispute Resolution.  Back to Cathay or Singapore for us."
800,Definitely will not recommend Emirates. This is by far the most excited flight I’ve been awaiting due to the hype. But the most horrible so far. My husband is sitting in Dubai at the moment and cannot access the WiFi. Neither could he access that board even though it’s part of the advertisement which is horrible and a cheat. How do you expect someone to get in touch with their family if the WiFi is not working. Even WiFi in AFRICA does work how much more a whole “Dubai “ always claiming to have the best the most the tallest. It’s all BS and the food was not good. Make a much more effort Emirates Cos you don’t need business class to have a great experience on board. We’ve traveled a lot and with different airlines and I’m safe to say Norwegian airlines even has a much better service. This might be the first and probably the last time flying Emirates 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
801,"Below par Economy class service from Dubai to Birmingham. May be their business class product is good, but economy class is really a night mare even they used 380, the biggest aircraft for service.The main issue starts from online check in. Issued boarding pass with a selected (free of cost once the check in started) seat and in actual they provide different seat. No explanation from the customer service even after many emails and chat. Not comprehended if flying in Economy class."
802,"Loved flying with you, was the best flight ever and nothing was too much. Comfy seats and lots of entertainment and food :) Wish i could experience 1st class"
803,"Incompetent, rude staff at Dubai airport who pretended to not see us and blanked us like children. Our connection was missed due to Emriates removing us from the second flight with NO notice. Their first flight was delayed and they ASSUMED we wouldn't make the second, which we did, but they wouldn't let us on. They admitted they did this thinking we wouldn't make it. The second flight was delayed due to a guy's passport being out of date so they could easily have rectified this. Consequently ended up losing a day and night of the holiday and Emirates have offered just air miles which is of no use to me. Appalling company."
804,We flew out from the UK to Australia via Dubai. Everything was fine on the flight. The only slight issue was I did not get my Skywards points.
805,"Wish I could give NO stars.Booked with Emirates because of their great reputation - worst mistake ever. As I was flying I was sent an email that I could not receive telling me my next flight was cancelled - it wasn't. The crew of my flight were not aware of this - I asked about the shortening connection time and was assured that as a published ""through"" flight all was well. Got to the departure gate for the connecting flight in time for the flight but was ignored by gate staff.The supervisor eventually looked at me and then said ""I offloaded you hours ago and I've closed the flight. I've booked you on another one so stop complaining"". I said I was in time for the flight, the flight wasn't closed as he was still doing the paperwork and I should be allowed on. Translated for me was the vile comment ""she's only a disabled foreign woman ignore her"". I was denied access to the plane. When asked what I should do he pointed to the departure gate seats and said wait there till the next flight. The vitriol in his voice was frightening.He did not tell me a hotel room had been arranged and he had the voucher. He refused to give me my old boarding pass which I grabbed from him. The wheelchair attendant helped me and by accident I found out about the hotel. I got to the hotel who knew nothing about me! However they did have a room and honored the voucher.Obviously I complained only to be ignore until I threatened to go to the press and discrimination board. Then I was offered a few air miles - not even enough to get to Dubai - as if I would willingly fly with them! Due to the delay and stress Emirates caused I ended up in hospital and Emirates just said it was my fault for booking the ticket!They have not credited the promised air miles and they have BLOCKED emails sent by me. What wonderful customer service!"
806,"@emirates. I am shocked how they treat pregnant women, so if you want to be escorted off a flight as you are boarding because you are pregnant… after spending thousands of dollars with them… fly @EMIRATES. I booked @EMIRATES air several months ago for my babymoon (last trip before baby) . I called the airline prior to ensure 1. They would let me on at 7 months  2. I would have no issues with emergency exit row as pregnant person.As my husband and I boarded our flight to Athens Greece,  we were greeted by the flight attendant who said “ Oh how cute… how many weeks are you?” to which I replied … about 7 months which is around27-30 weeks”. At this point several flight attendants barricaded us from moving forward and said “ DO NOT GO further you cannot get on this flight”. I could not believe what I was hearing as I had called @emirates advance to ensure the proper measures were taken to avoid issues such as this (@emirates locate this phone call, don’t you record these things ?) . Obviously, my doctor @weillcornell APPROVED  our plans just several days prior, as I was no health risk and not a high risk pregnancy. As all of the barricaded around us they called security and their “supervisor” who was nothing short of rude, refused to let us take a copy of his badge, and repeatedly shouted at my husband saying to get off the flight . I told them I had called in advance and to check their records that stated this. The supervisor made some bogus phone call in front of us and 30 seconds later came back with “ we have no record of that” . This started somewhat of a shouting match as my husband and I were both getting frustrated- it was midnight, I am 7 months pregnant, and we were getting tossed off a flight for a verbal informality of being asked how many weeks  pregnant I was. After doing this god awful dance with @emirates for nearly a half hour , (with every passenger now looking and security called) we complied or else we would have been a viral sensation of ”pregnant woman cuffed on plane”. I was not going to put my baby in destress. As we proceeded off the plane we asked to take pics of everyone badges and ID’s, they refused and turned their  badges around. We were told that it is illegal to take pictures on the plane , and that is “their law” .  It felt like a very targeted effort (being American) as we were told repeatedly whenever we asked a question this is “our law”.As we were escorted off the flight by several people (like criminals) , the bogus phone calling supervisor dumped us back at the gate and disappeared refusing to help further- be it with a voucher or anything to make the situation a hint less mortifying… he told us to call customer service and went into hiding (luckily some of this was filmed) @emirates. So here we are stranded at 1 a.m. in Newark Airport in NJ – with thousands of dollars lost on the departing and return flight (booked @emirates roundtrip), missed connecting flights that were paid for in advance and 2nights worth of hotel fare, that I am pretty sure @emirates “customer services” could care less about.  All of the Agents at the gate were told not to speak to us as we kept asking to recoup something…ANYTHING.  We were then escorted by a kind woman who does NOT work for @emirates to receive our luggage and get out of @emirates hair. Of course you can call customer service as I did 7 months pregnant in a baron airport on a sleeping aid at 1 a.m. only to receive  “ I have put notes in here and filed a claim… so sorry for the inconvenience” I have received nothing else further @Emirates, you are a disgrace! Your lack of “customer service” , negligent and rude stuff have me wondering how you are even in business.My husband and I will never book with you again so BUYER BEWARE."
807,"I've always had excellent experiences with Emirates First and Biz. This was 3 years ago back the last time I flew with them, though. So, unless they went downhill fast, they're ok in my book."
808,"I Just cannot believe how bad they have become, I have flown Emirates a few times and this last flight was simply terrible.Let me first state that the flight crew did just fine, I have no complaints there but the airport in Dubai is another matter entirely, I am disabled and asked for wheelchair assist at the airport for both the outward bound and the return flight, none were provided. I was ferried from arrivals to departure on a buggy then dropped at a corridor where I was met by one of the airport reps who, to  say the least, was totally disinterested in anything I had to say, I asked, as did others, where the wheelchairs were and he simply ignored anything that was said to him. Along with other, obviously disabled people, I was told to follow him, again I asked him where the wheelchairs were and he kept repeating, ""follow me"", we all had to walk to a train carriage and was taken to the departures area where we sat for quite a while waiting to go through the departures and security check area. When the time came to go to the aeroplane the same rep told us to follow him again and again he was asked for the wheelchairs he again ignored the question.I then had to walk a very long distance in pain to get to the security check area, I am only able to walk a very short distance that is why I asked for wheelchair assistance, by the time I got to the aeroplane I was in agony and my wife was extremely worried as I have passed out before because of the pain I am in. The same thing happened on the return journey and to make matters worse they changed the aircraft so we did not get the double seats I paid for, an extra £360 in total.I put in a claim for £120 for the double seats they didn't have on the A380 and it took over two months, three attempts at the claim and eight phone calls to get my money back.I told Emirates about my treatment at Dubai airport and received the usual disinterested platitudes that they were sorry I wasn't happy but they will try to improve, they won't of course as it seems to me they are not interested in disabled people.I will never travel with emirates again and I will tell my friends and family to avoid them like the plague."
809,Staff were a great help with my boarding issues.  Thanks Emirates!
810,"I am a frequent First class traveler on Emirates . This particular flight that we took ( EK379) from Phuket back to Dubai on May 1 2019 ,had no First class so we had to settle for Business class seats. Throughout the 6 hour and 30 minute midnight flight , I wasn’t served breakfast despite the incompetent and inefficient crew member having taken the order & being informed I would be served breakfast later . The appallingly inefficient lady crew in the business class conveniently wakes up only a few passengers and  decides to give the remaining a miss so that she could rest her lazy a$$! ( not like they do any real work anyway besides pretending to work by walking up & down the aisle) and ofcourse blatantly ignoring the call bells or responding to them 15 minutes after the bell goes. On complaining about the shoddy service  to one of the senior crew members , the  attendant actually agrees that ‘ Emirates doesn’t give a sh!t ‘ about Customer service ! So This explains it all ! The flight attendants hate their jobs , shamelessly & unapologetically display it to the passéngers and a billion dollar company like Emirates couldn’t give a flying F$&k about it !"
811,Always fly emirates great planes and staff are the best of any airline
812,"My wife & I flew Emirates business from Gatwick to Dubai and return and was extremely underwhelmed. The plane itself and seating is fine it was the staff on the aeroplane are simply not friendly , they appear to be void of personality and lack the enthusiasm and desire to look after their customers.They did not show us to our seats, general service was very slow and without a smile , choice of food was ordered and then quite a while later was told they had run out of it , one of the toilets was not working. The Business lounge in Dubai was drab , food selection was poor , service again lacked any personality. Did not feel we got value for money and would not recommend this airline as a result. Better recruitment, increased training and supervision required before this airline can improve."
813,"Booked with Emirates as everyone raved about it - upgraded to First Class and everything was perfect until I reached Dubai. Was off loaded from the flight over 2 hours before departure - when I was flying in to make the connection. Gate supervisor refused to look at me or speak to me (I am a disabled elderly female). Non-Emirates staff assisted and translated vile comments and instructions to wait where I was - departure gate until the next flight in 7 hours. Emirates left me stranded. Airport staff help me and what I had not been told by Emirates was that there was hotel room available for me. By the time I was given this information I had 1 hour in the hotel before having to return.Tried to contact Emirates - only via website with VERY RESTRICTED character space for complaint, online chat - nothing can be done, sales on phone - not procedure.A great shame because the flight crews were exceptional.Will never fly this discriminatory airline again."
814,i've flewn Emirates a couple times and the services were great i honestly don't know why the rating here is poor.  thank you Emirates
815,"As travelling to Thailand can be quite arduous, I wanted to ensure the trip would be as stress-free as possible. Therefore, I booked with Emirates as I believed they had a good reputation and wanted to maximise our time there even though it was more expensive than other airlines.During our flights we were offered hardly any water. Flight attendants made you feel it was an inconvenience to ask for more water. They also use an excessive amount of single use plastic (and ironically are posting about earth day on social media which is just an embarrassment!) . I also thought I should note that on every single flight I have had with Emirates (which is a total of 6 now), there has never been my preference of food choice available. It’s shocking that there is no option to be able to purchase your own food or water. Our flight was delayed taking off and delayed when landing. My boyfriend’s bag did not show up. We were instructed by Emirates to wait until there were only a couple of bags left on the conveyer belt before leaving (over 40 minutes even though it was quite clear his bag wasn’t there). We then missed our connecting flight due to all these delays. We were offered no compensation, and the bag didn't show up for three days. Over a month later, the airline are claiming they gave us money at the airport. We had to buy our own essentials and pay the cost for a new flight that we missed due to their delays. We missed a whole day of our holiday, and spent 5 hours at the airport waiting for our next flight (in which the staff were extremely rude and didn't apologise). We spent another whole day shopping for essentials and new clothes."
816,Changed my flight and telling me they won't charge me for changing my flight date. What a cracker!!!!Will never use it again......
817,Terrible and CarelessI flew twice and I regret it!Very bad customer care and very bad organization in the airport: Team keep saying go there and go there bla bla!Use any other airline!
818,"Worst travel/ airline company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with , I’m a frequent flyer and will never use this airline again. Calls and email to customers services have been a waster of time ."
819,"*Arrived Auckland to see that a flight to Wellington had been cancelled.This was a Jetstar flight Code Share Number booked with Emirates, they could not give us another flight for 2 days and no hotels were available, via Jetstar customers services.we managed to book our own flight at our own expense.  We contacted Emirates for a refund who said its a Jetstar problem who have said its an Emirates problem, as we paid through Emirates. To date everyone has refused to pay any sort of refund both blaming each other. EMIRATES service and flights are not as good as they used to be."
820,This airline is terrible in checking in. Today at check in area 3 at DXB terminal 3 there were around hundred people standing in line and only 2 people were there for checking in. Don’t understand why I paid more when i can check in with another airlines in 5 min.
821,Premium economy class of Emirates is like business class of British Airways.
822,"Had flight from Dubai to Sydney, and later on the same month from Singapore to Dubai. Very friendly and cooperative cabin crew. Pilot kept on updating us on the traffics situation and flight. Served food was fresh and delicious. Service and flight entertainment was very good. I had breath shortness during flight, and the staff reacted immediately, provided me with oxygen, monitored my condition, and let me change my seat to the wider, so I could lay down and rest. They act professionally. Emirates never had delay with their flight. It is bit pricier compare to other alternatives, but more reliable, comfortable, trustworthy airline.I would recommend this airline for your comfortable flights."
823,"After promising refund none yet, this is just sad"
824,"I have recently flown return flights from Heathrow to Dubai with my wife and two of my immediate family and the experience was literaly faultless. The level of comfort in Economy on their Airbus 380 flights, with no extra seats squeezed in to increase capacity is exellent, as have previous flights been also, and I have now joined their loyalty scheme.A Newman."
825,"Excellent flight from Karachi to Dubai. Friendly staff, good in flight entertainment, right on time and definitely clean and tidy. Keep it up emirates!"
826,"I worked in Dubai for 2 years and last month I thought to bring my family as well, so on my Emirates flight from Australia to Dubai I was travelling with my wife and 5 yr old daughter. That was the time when I had the worst experience of my life about which I still get nightmares.During this long journey I faced rude and racist staff who actually don't know how to do their jobs properly and this totally surprises me that how Emirates comes under one of the best airlines category!!!! After we landed at Dubai airport, me and my family was taken for a random security check where they separated me with my family and I was unable to understand the reason behind it.I clearly stated that I am ready to cooperate but I have the right to know what is it for and where have they taken my family but instead of answering they became rude and asked me to ""Shut Up"". I had a heated argument with one of the official & the other one took away my phone and snatched my passport that instant & vanished keeping me locked in a small room.At least 100 thoughts ran in my mind & I was helpless as my family was travelling to UAE for the first time & my daughter was scared the instant it all started. After 1 hr one official came and said that my UAE visa has got expired which was totally false as I am working there from past 2 years & have work visa. Then he said that I am drunk and threatened me for an alcohol test to which I totally lost my mind and explained that I was offered wine on the flight and I just had 1 glass but he was not ready to listen & it felt like I am being framed for something bad.I didn't even know where they have kept my family & they kept me isolated for about 6-7 hours. After 8 hours I was taken out of that stinky room and when I met my family I could see the fear in the eyes of my wife and my crying daughter as they were also been treated in the same way.Then in the 9th hour they handed over our phones and passport & asked us to return to Australia. On our way back I realised that despite people suggesting me not to take your family to Dubai I made a huge mistake by not listening to them."
827,"I had nightmare in their long flight from Dubai to JFK, their flight attendant dropped a cup of hot tea on my belly and it got burned really bad.Problem was they didn't give me ointment immediately to ease the pain, after they served the whole plane they cameback with pain killers which i refused to take.For 12 hours I had burnt pain I never had such a burn.But worst thing happened later after waiting months after my complains they just offer milage. I felt they are not human they torture you for 12 hours and easiest thing they will offer you is milage, after 6 months i still has the scars imagine if it was on my face or somewhere that was showing...I am suffering from PTSD too, I have to travel alot and when its time to serve food or hot beverages my heart bit rates suddenly goes high and i am suffering from it.I never ever fly with them."
828,"Several months after booking a two week holiday, I received an e-mail from Emirates to let me know my return flight had been pushed back a full 24 hours. This obviously caused issues financially and personally having to sort an extra day's accommodation and also try to get extra time off work.I complained to Emirates and was met with a dismissive and  disinterested attitude from the customer service team, they just offered to reschedule me or cancel the booking which were not acceptable for me. When asked what their complaints procedure is I was basically told they don't have one and the solutions offered were final.I will choose alternative airlines in future and hopefully receive a better after sale service."
829,"we have travelled a lot with Emirates in business class, seatings are comfortable, the food served is good, their lounges are excellent where you can relax and dine before your flight."
830,"I definitely  am considering a change of airlines as the last few experiences  with Emirates have been extremely  disappointin years ago were the stand out airline for service This is not the case anymoreMost people only use Emirates from the uk to get to Asia/ Australia There are now better airlines servicing  this routeSingapore,  Cathy,  Qantas or fly to USA with virgin and delta airlinesAll have stepped up and challenge Emirates Are now complacent and disinterested in customer satisfaction"
831,"Currently sat on emirates flight waiting to take off from Dubai to BHX, just got off a 14 hour flight from Australia. Food that awful I have not eaten and was not offered an alternative. Paid for WiFi which did not work, I told staff several times that it was not working and that I had paid for it and could I have my money back, nothing was done. Not impressed with emirates at all!"
832,"From 1st March 19, Emirates have decided that when purchasing a business or indeed first class ticket using reward miles, that traveller will be treated very differently to a ""paid"" ticket holder, in that they will not be provided with chauffeur drive. Quite appalling that Emirates feel the need to save money by penalising its most loyal customers! To add to the insult, Emirates will not even honour the service on tickets purchased BEFORE the rule change."
833,After we bought the tickets they replaced the plain a smaller one and they have changed the airport from Heathrow to Gatwick. I think this is too much at least for me!
834,"Hi we are not happy with the experience we have had with you at all. We flew out of Birmingham on Wednesday 13th to Dheli via Dubai. Firstly when we got to Dubai is where the issues started as our flight was changed to domestic flight FZ0431 where we were supplied a horrible dry breakfast with only water whilst your cabin crew had omelettes and sausages. During the flight we asked for a cup of Tea and coffee and was told we had to pay for it even this was included up until our flight was changed for a domestic flight but to have the tea we would have to pay for it in Durhams which we didn't have as it was a short stop over so we were refused drinks, But the worst was yet to come.Once we landed in Delhi we collected out luggage to find all the locks had been broken off and a number of items had been taken from our luggage including a number of gifts we had purchased for relatives. The last thing you would expect going on holiday is for your personal belongings to be taken by staff it's an absolute disgrace. We then tried to complain to Emirates at Delhi airport who did not want to know and told us the luggage had been damaged in transport but how is it all 5 of our luggage was damaged and nobody else? but that still doesn't explain where all our missing items are. We were stuck complaining for 4 hours after such a long flight which is not ideal as I suffer from diabetes and with no proper food or drinks supplied on the flight I started to get really unwell. After sitting at Delhi airport for 4 hours your staff just wanted to get rid of us but you could see in their faces they knew exactly what had happened to us but instead they threatened us very clearly with a drug search as the luggage had been opened that there may be drugs planted into the suitcases but the baggage had only been in your possession the entire time but they kept threatening us with this and us being arrested if we did not leave. scared at the thought of being arrested of drugs in a different country we decided to leave as your staff would have done anything to make us leave.If they had thought of any foul play from the start they would have just searched our luggage not to just threaten us to leave.I am extremely disappointed with how we have been treated and will be taking this further"
835,"I flew to Pakistan from London Heathrow via Dubai, and I had to fly with my bag and jacket in my feet because their stupid staff couldn’t be bothered not only that I was allocated a seat but I was told to find a seat as my seat was taken. I have complained to the Uk team and they replied to me with a reference to an incorrect flight details so not only the staff on board are rude, unethical and unprofessional people who deal with queries and complains are the worst too. I and my family will never fly with an airline who treat people like crap on board.I don’t recommend Emirates to anyone."
836,"Generally good service, until lunch. Was served an Economy meal on a Business Class plate. I could check the Economy menu, so I knew what it was, and it was pretty inedible. Staff on board were initially adamant that I was having a Business Class meal, but later relented. Emirates seemed unwilling to acknowledge the issue, offered me 10000 points (hardly worth it) and noted it was possible to 'source a meal from a different section of the aircraft', without an apology for the mistake. So watch out - Emirates seem to think this practice is acceptable."
837,Will never fly with emerites again. Flight delayed and connection had left. 48 hours before l could get a flight home. Kept in arrival for 5 hours before securing a flight. Passengers were spoken to dreadfully and told to sit down shut up and wait.Dreadful experience never again.
838,"London to Kathmandu. Booked through Skyscanner as an Emirates flight but the second leg from Dubai was with airline, fly Dubai which is a budget airline with no entertainment. Emirates customers do get a free meal but it felt a bit misleading. The leg from London to Dubai was good. The entertainment, food and staff were great. Return flight my seat recliner was broken so that it wouldn't lock into position. I was moved to another seat where the flexible head support was also broken. Maybe a few more quality checks are needed."
839,"Don’t put your life in danger!Worst experience ever. When we boarded at 3:30 in the morning, I just wanted to get some sleep. No chance, in the seat behind me was guy who decided he wants to sing, dance, talk and abuse other passengers. Every half an hour or so, he disappeared for some time and come back even more excited. I was scared. How can you get drugs into airplane?? Cabin crew knew how uncomfortable we are, they did nothing. He would be thrown out of ryanair flight! Never again!"
840,"The flight was good. It was a good experience, but the baggage have been delayed by more than 48 hours. I contacted so many times opened a claim and asked for the compensation process, but it has not been helpful at all. The travel advisor tells me wait for more and more time and even has not sent me any email regarding the baggage and the compensation process."
841,"I was on flight from Boston to Dubai first leg of journey but on flight from Dubai to Dhaka was awful. The cabin was very hot and no bags were provided for diapers for those with children. Thus dirty diapers shoved under seats got on my pants and shoe, this created an unbearable with stench, I’m also some asthmatic.  breathing hard and after left plane debarked Ipassed out in airport and US Embassey had me taken to hospital. My BP was very high but finally embassy and Dhaka ER hospital clearedme to continue my journey to Sylhet. I have never had such an awful plan journey, where staff didn’t do there best to help. It was like they avoided us. For Gods sakes provides diaper bags and collect them. I’m now Leary to fly Emarities again and would not recommend unless you can afford at minimum business class I hope my flight home March 7 is better but not allowed to upgrade. I remember when flying was pleasantStephen Batchelder. nCBNUS"
842,"Great company with a good food, awesome entertainment and customer service. Planes are very big and comfortable. Good presents for the kids, always nice treats during the flight, blankets, headsets, small toiletries included.The only reason I do not give 5 stars is a customer service not on the plane. One of our flights was cancelled and we were not informed at all, so at the airport we had not so good surprise. Anyway they put us on the next flight. But very inconvenient."
843,"i had my wife's watch and camera stolen from my luggage. camera had my sisters weeding pictures and camera itself is worth 1800 uk pounds!!! and when i complained this is what they email me .Dear Mr Patel, Thank you for taking the time to contact Emirates. I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your feedback. I was sorry to learn about the difficulties you experienced with your luggage after your recent flight to London.  On behalf of Emirates please accept our sincerest apologies for any upset that this may have caused. Please be assured we are not complacent about this matter, I wish to assure you that such incidents are rare and our security departments monitor any reported incidents to identify particular patterns, in this case it would appear to be an isolated incident. Whilst security measures are in operation at all airports on the Emirates network, it is not possible to have constant surveillance on individual pieces of luggage and identify specific individuals who may have come into contact with the luggage at all stages of its journey. There are certain items for which we do not accept any liability in accordance with our 'Conditions of Carriage' and all passengers can familiarise themselves with these prior to travel. Please find a copy of the relevant paragraph for ease of reference: ARTICLE 8 — BAGGAGE 8.3 Items you must not carry in your Baggage 8.3.3 You must not include in Checked Baggage fragile or perishable items, valuable items (including, for example, money, jewellery, precious metals), computers, personal electronic devices, stored data, any medication or medical equipment which may be required in-flight or during your trip or which cannot be quickly replaced if lost or damaged, house or car keys, valuable documents (including, for example, business documents, passports and other identification documents, negotiable papers, securities deeds) or samples.

Yours sincerely Zaleha ChaytorCustomer Affairs UKI will never fly with them and will never recommend to any one... ______________________________________"
844,Nice airline and a very nice experience to fly with these guys. Unfortunately expiring my points is a no-no so I wont be a loyal customer Im afraid as I kind of wanted to keep my points thank you.
845,"Clean planes, helpful staff, the seats are large and comfy. My luggage got broke they shipped me a new one at home. My flight was overbooked, they put me in business twice. Great customer service..."
846,"Very easy comfortable caring Airline.  From booking seats to enquiries, special assistance, liaison with staff both on the phone and in person are absolutely commendable. I booked Emirates from London Heathrow to Dubai and onwards to Thiruvananthapuram. I've never experienced such easy carefree travel. I feel disappointed when my search shows Emirates are not linked to certain places I'd like to visit as I have no inclination to travel with another airline. If you're considering Emirates go for it! You won't be sorry"
847,"I booked on Emirates.com a flight (Manchester - Dubai - Entebbe), but my connecting flight from Glasgow with flybe was cancelled, so I missed the connection (no show). When I requested refund, Emirates refunded the full ticket (even by law not required, because I booked Flybe separately).Very helpful call center, excellent and consumer friendly airline. Top Top, never experienced such an excellent customer service. Emirates. Consumer friendly and compliant with all EU laws and regulations & going the ""extra mile"" - only Emirates."
848,"Truly awful - they clearly don't care about reviews as they're not responding on here but we were dumped in Manchester when our flight was supposed to be going to Gatwick.We were then told we were going to be put on a coach to central london in the early hours of the morning, not offered a hotel or onward travel. Just going to be dumped..They're refusing to compensate us for additional costs incurred and as such we will not be flying with them again.Seems a bit stupid to lose customers, get negative reviews etc over £300 but clearly they don't care once they have your money."
849,"Flew Glasgow to Sydney and return via Dubai from Bali , Business class, first time .Flights out great,crew ,service in flight bar etc, great . Bali to Dubai EK 399, 777-300ER,  terrible!!. Flight crew not really interested, service rushed , in flight TV system at our seats, 8J and 8K , had to be rebooted twice, 30 mins later still problems so just watched a movie when it worked!! . After service ,no sign of crew, some people pressed the button, took staff for ever to come and attend, shocking service altogether.The member of staff in the galley after service would have been just as well using a hammer for all the noise he was intent of making. I would like the CEO of Emirates or any other person in senior management to get a grip of staff issues on there aircraft.You read all the time about lowering standards from this airline and nothing seems to be done about it by them, the people who are earning vast salaries and laughing at you with the money you are paying for  a Business Class product that is no better than a  B+B in an average hotel in Europe.Try another airline for BC and save yourself a lot of money , oh and hopefully decent manners from the crew .I always say , if you are not happy in your job, go elsewhere, as there are many out there that would give there left arm for work with this so called  Top World Airline .Flights were EK28,EK 414 out, EK399 and EK27 back on Sunday the 10/10/2019 .James Harris"
850,"My Flight no was EK583 on 4th Feb 2019 Seat no-24K Zone FThe aircrew ( ladies) were reluctant to provide customer service. I wanted water to drink my life-saving medicine three times but they did not give me water or told about self-service. During the whole flight, they did not come for help and not help customers and enjoyed at their station with chatting their colleagues. Negligence and bad customer service for the economy class passengers are really disappointing. I will think twice before buying from Emirates as my personal experience shows that they do not care about economy class passenger at all. Be careful you can have similar experience too."
851,"Dubai Connect...T&C's gimmick Emirates opened a new destination in Edinburgh during Oct/Nov 2018 and offered connections to rest of the world. Connections times were not that great most of the time ranging from 7+/8+ hours to destination. They have offered Dubai Connect to passengers travelling in all classes if their wait time is more than 8+ hours, so which made sense for the extended connection times. This Dubai connect offering was only for 3 months just to attract and any new bookings after Jan 2019 will not be eligible for Dubai Connect because there T&Cs says qualifying ticket prices should be £999/traveler. So if you are in Scotland and if you want to travel with Emirates don't choose Edinburgh as Origin you will end up in airport for 8+ hours in airport and don't get distracted by Dubai Connect. If you are from Edinburgh you don't get Dubai Connect"
852,"I love Emirates. The flights are clean, the business class is great."
853,"I am Emirates Frequent Flyer, flying every year twice from Sydney to Europe, but I am horrified how Emirates customer service changed. I was robbed either in Sydney or Dubai flying with Emirates and it seems nobody really cares how this will affect my relationship to Emirates. Furthermore this situation has been caused by Emirates attendant at check-in desk and Emirates doesn't want to take responsibility for actions of their own employees. From my point of view, this is break of UAE The Federal Law No. 24 of 2006 on Consumer Protection.Emirates doesn't value their customers. I will never fly with Emirates again."
854,"A few years ago it was one of my favourite companies. In last 3 years I have flown with Emirates only 2 times (UK-Far East with transfer, return ticket) and definitely I must to write: this is second company after Etihad which is quickly falling down from top. Today I finished trip TH-UK and all 4 flights I noticed same problems: bad customer service in economy class. Flight attendants not present during almost whole flight. 6-8 hours flight only 2 times passengers got something to drink. Yesterday BKK-DXB onboard very rude flight staff. I noticed some passengers didn't get second food (whatever it was, s because they got some sleep. Even none stewardess tried to ask later when they woke up does someone want this food. Simple: who was sleeping he lost it. Next flight DXB-MAN attendants were lazy and not very nice. Talking a lot, flirting with themselves and definitely not interested about passengers. But they were excessively nice to guy who ""asked"" about sit in higher class after take off ;) Food is poor. 5 years ago was ok but now portion is small and without a taste. Return flight to my city someone took from carousel my backpack. Guy from Emirates airport staff whom I asked about help called that guy who swapped backpacks. Then he told me to wait for that guy who took the backpack, he will come soon and we can swap the backpacks again. He left me with not my backpack at public area and told me: keep eye on this. I lost two hours waiting and finally airport security guys came to me and asked many questions about what I am doing here. I told them what happened. They did not believe me and checked everything around me with detector and told me this situation is definitely against airport safety rules. Big shame for Emirates. I am frequent passenger UK-Far East (different airlines) but I consider I will not use anymore Emirates because at the moment customer service is unacceptable."
855,"My wife and I paid to choose our seats on a flight to Amsterdam in November 2018 flying Emirates. When we boarded our flight at Dubai we were given different seats in a different row without a window even though we paid for a window seat and in a different row. When I complained to cabin crew they were not helpful and kept saying “plane full”. I and our travel agent have sent emails requesting a refund and to date, January 2019, have not received a refund nor heard from them. Do not pay to choose your own seats as emirates will put you in different seats and keep the fee."
856,"We booked a retour ticket from Amsterdam to Jakarta. The flight to Jakarta was fine. The food was not great, but okay. Then the last week before our flight back we suddenly got a message our flight back was overbooked. We were obliged to take another flight.In the mean time we traveled to Bali and Lombok and already booked an inbound flight back to Jakarta.With their new flight proposal we had no way of getting there in time, or we had to prolong our stay, which was not an option for us. Or we had to stay in the airport in Dubai for a day, which seemed awful. We discussed all this via a chat system, this took hours and hours in total because they could not arrange something. The last week of our vacation was completely ruined because of this. We wanted to call the support service in stead of this annoying chat system, but they only spoke Indonesian.Eventually we had to stay in the area of the airport in Jakarta for a whole day, to take another flight, which is not nice at all. They didn't want to pay anything or bump us to a higher class, for all the trouble. They were arrogant and unfriendly. Probably because we were just Economy Class.Never again will I fly with Emirates."
857,I think Emirates Airline should hire Customer Expirience/Customer Care Senior Director with huge expirience in Quality Management in order to get in line all their employees. Rude employees on every corner. Emirates Management do something about this.
858,"Very,very,very bad service,at the airport !refused to help me and now I am going to miss my Brothers funeral !!Avoid at all costs !!!! and choose another carrier."
859,"Best air company I've flown with so far. Great service, good food"
860,"When things go as planned everything is marveĺlous, e.g. the courtesy car arrived 5 minutes early and the driver took care of our bags in and out of the car.When things do not go  as planned you have grumpy passengers.  30 minutes before boarding we were called and told we would have to change seats.  In fact the seats were not too bad even though my wife and I were not actually side by side.But the reason seemed so ludicrous, a passenger on the previous flight had lost his or her mobile in the seat and for safety reasons the seat could not be used till the mobile was found. How pathetic when you think of aĺl the scanning equipment we are subject to at the airport.  And what if every crank with a grudge pretends they have lost their mobile in their seat."
861,"I've had the most disappointing experience with Emirates,  firstly, after booking a return flight to Zagreb, Croatia with additional cost for every seat, they changed my flights to Flydubai without honoring any of my seat purchases. When i contacted Emirates,  they said that they can't do anything for me and that i must now liaise with Flydubai. I contacted Flydubai and had a reply after four months in an email telling me that I had to liaise with Emirates because my ticket booking is with them. So to and fro between Emirates and Flydubai i achieved no success.  When i arrived in Zagreb, my luggage was seriously damaged.  I filled out the damage from at the airport and sent it to Emirates with photographic evidence.  After two months i still have no reply. On the way back we tried to check in with Flydubai which was difficult because Emirates did not transfer my booking onto them after they changed my flight. On Flydubai i had to purchase everything all over again including entertainment, food, drinks and without any proper service or curtesy. I have been Emailing Flydubai and Emirates about this but i continue to be ignored. This has been the worst airline experience. I gave them one star because zero star wasn't an option."
862,"Terrible experience. I recently flew to Bali from LHR with Emirates on a return trip and they damaged my surfboard on both trips.I have taking my surfboard on many trips including Bali multiple times with other airlines and never had my board damaged before. Twice on one trip just shows the complete disregard and lack of respect provided for our personal property!I raised a complaint on 24th Dec and its now 11th Jan and still have had no response from Emirates., When i contacted there support today they were unhelpful, unprofessional and didnt even try help with my issue."
863,ON ONE OF MY FLIGHTS WITH EMIRATES FROM LONDON TO DUBAI I HAD AN 8 YEAR OLD CHILD SITTING DIRECTLY BEHIND ME AND FOR THE FLIGHT DURATION OF ABOUT 7 HOURS THIS CHILD PLAYED GAMES THAT CONSTANTLY TAPPED THE SCREEN CONTINUOUSLY NON STOP. THE ONLY TIME HE STOPPED PLAYING WAS FOR 5 MINUTES TO GO TO THE TOILET AND FOR 10 MINUTES TO EAT. THE CREW MADE THE BOY'S MOTHER WHO WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM AWARE OF THE SITUATION ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO CONSIDER HOW EXTREMELY ANNOYING IT MUST BE FOR THE PERSON SITTING IN FRONT BUT HAD NO CONSIDERATION WHATSOEVER FOR THE COMFORT OF OTHERS KNOWING VERY WELL THAT I COULD NOT RELAX OR TRY TO SLEEP AS THE TAPPING WOULD VIBRATE THROUGH TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD.EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE PLAYING THESE TYPE OF GAMES BUT EVEN IF IT DISRUPTS 1 PAYING CUSTOMER THEN WHY SHOULD THAT PERSON SUFFER FOR THE PLEASURE OF OTHERS AND THAT'S WHY I THINK EMIRATES SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM EITHER BY TRYING TO SOMEHOW DAMPEN THE VIBRATION COMING THROUGH OR HAVE THESE GAMES THAT NEED CONSTANT TAPPING DELETED FROM THE MENU OR PUT A TIME FRAME ON THESE PARTICULAR GAMES LIKE PLAY FOR A WHILE AND THEN HAVE IT AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF FOR A LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE RESUMING. I'M SURE THE EXPERTS CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT FOR IT IS SO UNFAIR THAT YOU PAY FOR YOUR TICKET JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND YET ON SUCH A LONG TRIP EVERYBODY IS RELAXING AND SLEEPING AND YOU CANNOT. (SO FRUSTRATING) UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS SITUATION BEFORE YOU JUST CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE.I CERTAINLY HOPE EMIRATES WILL CONSIDER FIXING THIS MAJOR PROBLEM.
864,"Hi All,My Brother in law died on the 7th December 2018 on an Emirates flight into Dubai, My wife was Next of Kin. We still have not heard from the Airline he died on their plane and how etc. My wife had to battle for 11 days to one, find him and then get him Home no help from Emirates. Now they really do know how to do customer service and feel for us , in May 2019 seven of the close family were due to fly out to see my Brother In Law , as His and My wife Mum passed away last year we were going to do a service for her.As my Brother in law has passed away. Our flight tickets no longer needed , they have five months to resell, yet only going to give a small refund back.In summary we thought they were the best , look after people, my brother in law flew every month long haul, (job oli rigger) in business class. Maybe they are not that good after All?"
865,"Horrible service, Horrible people, horrible place to stop.... I am a platinum One World and Star Alliance member. (So I fly a lot). Everytime I fly with Emirates, there is a problem of some sort and everytime they manage to push the rudeness boundary even further. Many years ago I worked for them and I remember how much customer service meant to them. It is a shame what they have become. I hope you go out of business."
866,"On my return from KBL to AKL was awful in July. their customer service in KBL was so terrible never had respect to their customers. Then no enough time for our connection in Brisbane, I have to run to the next gate as they were keep taking my name on the airport speakers, then when we came to AKL they didn't give my lagged bcoz they didn't transfer in Brisbane from one airplane to another as there was no enough time. They gave me the lagged after 3 days with a lot of stins and wholes. I emailed and post a lot of times on their Facebook page but no one cares lol...no more Emirates"
867,Arrogant and upolite crew whom only care about how they look rather than giving the excellent customer service they boast about so much! I fly emirates regularly to Dubai (easiest and quickest for me) and with every flight my disappointment sadly grows as I used to love flying with them but the service is just so poor nowadays.
868,"They changed our plane from an A380 to a 777 six weeks before our 14 hour flight. Didn't tell us. Separated our seats. Wouldn't change them back or offer an alternative. Denied our child access to the lounge, even though I'm a Qantas Club member and am entitled to bring a guest (wanted us to pay $100 USD). It took 5 phone calls to get our seats for our second flight together (6 hours on the telephone), then I got food poisoning on the flight home. This wonderful experience in business class cost us nearly $25,000 AUD. Their business class is 2x3x2 and not a fully flat bed. It's basically premium economy for a business class fare. Ground and lounge staff rudest we've encountered. Avoid them at all costs."
869,"Shame on you Emirates, no quality food and not very friendly services."
870,"WIDE SEATS, VERY KIND STAFF, GOOD FOOD"
871,"I was trying to get my Fiance here from Ghana and was working with Cleo U. She was absolutely amazing, even when I had to reschedule the flight once due to a delay in him receiving his visa. Cleo remained professional, kind and absolutely helpful throughout the entire process. She made me feel like a valued customer the entire time and never made it seem like I was a bother. It was a great pleasure working with Cleo and look forward to working with her in the future."
872,"A horrifying experience with Emirates that will marred me to stay away from this airline for the rest of my life.Just after I boarded the plane from Casablanca to Dubai last month, I requested for an airsick bag from the flight attendant. She pointed out to me in the toilet and I took one and went back to my seat. The same flight attendant approached me to find out how I was and I told her that I didn’t have my lunch so I am feeling a bit hungry and asked for something to munch and drink which she offered. Another 2 or 3 more attendants came by to ask about my health being and I told them that I am fine. Finally, one attendant, believe to be the supervisor approached to tell me that I have to be offloaded. I was shocked with disbelief that by merely asking for an airsick bag could lead to one being offloaded? I was merely hungry with an empty stomach, no fits, no heart attack? The attendant did not take my temperature assuming that I am having high fever? As I refused to move my butt, the attendant then threatened me with facing the consequences for this flight delay with 300 passengers on board.I then have no choice but to follow the ground staff out of the airplane to see the airport doctor. The doctor inspected and then told the ground staff that I am not sick and therefore is fit to fly but the plane has already took off. I was left alone and had to make my own hotel arrangements, food, transportation all at my own expense. The next day, I had to pay for my ticket back home. When I asked the counter staff why I had to pay the additional cost, he rudely told me that it was my fault for being sick and to be offloaded so therefore I have to pay the penalty. I didn’t have any morrocan dirham left with me so he asked me to pay in Euros and the amount he took from me is doubled than what I have to pay if I have the dirham. I guess I am just a female who can be bullied all the way but I didn’t want to argue then as I needed the ticket badly just to get back home! When I got back home, I emailed the airline on how distressed I was being treated in that manner by the crew members when they merely assumed I was sick and threw me out of the plane haplessly and having to bear all the unnessasary  costs. Airline Customer Affairs, Areej Dalanni replied that they appreciate my disappointment and followed guidelines to offload me so all cost and arrangements are by passengers themselves. No empathy at all?  The End."
873,A year ago my connecting flight was delayed and subsequently cancelled. Asked for help from a local agent. He refused to help in that my connecting flight was cancelled because of the volcano in Bali. I understood that. What I needed was explanation as to options available to me. I approached the agent four times and he refused to answer my questions. Three days later I managed to get a flight back to the UK. I have complained about the local agent but they have not replied to my correspondence about his behaviour. I can only assume that they actually don’t really care. That the agent was doing what was expected of him. That this was the level of customer service local agents are trained to provide. Although i am 75 I still work as a consultant in the travel industry. When I am asked about Emirates I am more than happy to tell their potential customers about my experience when stranded for 3 days in Dubai.
874,"Terrible customer service! We booked a flight to Bangkok and went via Dubai. We arrived late and there was a problem getting off the flight so we had to wait for 30 minutes before we could disembark the aircraft. We was told we would have to collect our baggage and re-check it back in again on to our connecting flight, we was also handed a ticket explaining at some airports you will need to collect you baggage and re-check it back in. I questioned this as I’ve never had to do this before with other airlines and we are frequent flyers, however, we was again assured we would have to re-check in the bags. Off we went to the baggage claim carousels where we waited and waited until there was no more bags left. We went to the lost baggage and then we was told we do not need to collect the baggage as this will automatically be transferred to our connecting flight.  So after arriving late, problems/delay getting off the plane and the baggage situation we was now pressed for time. We then went through security and asked for the gate number we needed to go to off we went to our gate. On arrival at the gate we showed the emirates staff our boarding cards and asked them to confirm we are at the right gate which they confirmed we was. With 10 minutes until boarding this did not seem right as there was nobody else around. We asked again at the Emirates desk and they confirmed this is the right gate. 10minutes went by and still no one was there. We went back to the Emirates desk they checked on their systems and then we was told we was at the wrong gate and we needed to get the train back to the other end of the airport. We asked the lady on the desk to call the staff on the correct gate number to advise we was on our way. Both of us had to run through the airport (my partner also with a broken knee)  to the other side. We got to our gate 1 minute after the gate closed. Door was still open to go on to the plane and we was told we could not board the flight as we are late and to speak to customer services. They refused to let us on and had to wait in line for customer services. They said we could not board the flight and even called the bag handlers and said they needed to remove our bags from the aircraft as we would not be boarding. I sai this is absolutely ludicrous, the time it would take to retrieve our baggage we could have boarded. They was very unpleasant and unhelpful. They then advised us we could get the next flight however there would be a small fee. The small fee was not small at all! They demanded we pay a fee of £420.00 to be transferred to the next flight which leaves in 45 minutes. We had no choice but to pay the addiditional money and had no time to be able to challenge them or speak to a manager. There’s was another 22 people who all missed the connecting flight to Bangkok due to their errors/problems who was all made to pay extra for the next flight. We had to run back to the other end of the airport again and just made it to the gate on time. Once we boarded the aircraft there was hardly anyone on the aircraft. There was row after row all completely empty. Then it gets better, they announced they was waiting on some people who was still due to board so we could not leave. (No one waited for us) The aircraft was not very clean and the ICE entertainment system was broken and we was told we could not move seats dispite the hundreds of empty seats. I had to ask for new headphone as they did not work either. The food was very basic, not the best at all. The whole experience was very poor. Their attitudes were terrible. This was my first and last time I would ever fly with these! Never again. Such poor service. This is a real shame, as I am a frequent flyer and travel all over the world with my company. Our company and colleagues will never use them again, such a shame."
875,"Always an amazing experience to travel with emirate, polite staff, food is just ok, entertainment system is great, it start the moment you sit down not like some other airlines where u have to wait for the plane to take off. Stop over to Asia is always not too long. keep up the good work, I hope I won’t have to come back on here to complain."
876,"an amazing experience, the best airline in the world"
877,"We always use emirates and love the stopover in Dubai which offers you a visa free access on arrival so you can explore Dubai on your long stopover. The service, food and ICE entertainment is of decent standard. We will be flying again soon on Emirates for the holiday break and hope it doesnt dissapointment us!"
878,I have been a regular traveller with Emirates since 2006 back and forth between UK and Dubai monthly. I have never had any issues with their service at all.I have recently decided to change my route via Dublin as I live in Belfast. This was to save on the Belfast to mainland UK flight which I have to take since Emirates do not fly from N. Ireland.My company purchases business class tickets and a colleague at work informed me that I could fly from Dublin and take advantage of the complimentary chauffeur service for business travel.He lives outside of London and the service is provided up to 70 miles from all UK airports which Emirates operate out of. (Distance over this cap is payable).For some reason though...they offer a measly 70km cap from Dublin airport.Why are Dublin travellers treated differently Emirates??
879,"No value of customers , the luxurious aircraft with the worse abusive customer service"
880,"Hi, I just wanted to write about my experience flying with Emirates this week on the Manchester to Dubai route. I'm 6ft 6"" (198cm) and therefore I feel its necessary when travelling long haul to try to reserve extra legroom seats. I paid £75 each in order to feel comfortable for the 7 hour journey. Unfortunately I selected seat 41K. This seat has the emergency exit door jutting out which severely restricts legroom. If I wanted to stretch my legs out I would need to position them at an angle which would encroach on my neighbour sat at seat 41J.Not only is there restricted legroom, there is also a very strong draft through the door which has chilled my right foot and leg to the point that I struggled to feel my foot. Further, the ICE entertainment screen was inoperative (and much smaller than standard seats due the fact it has to fit inside the gap in between the seats). I had to use the little control pad which was clunky and not the experience I was expecting. The tray table is so low that I had to tuck my feet under my seat (which is virtually impossible) just so the items on my tray didn't tip up as it would have sat on my knee if I hadn't done this. I'm order to change what was on the screen I had to place the food tray on the door however, the air steward instructed me this was against the rules and that I had to keep this on my tray rendering my entertainment system redundant until the air steward collected it. The service from the rest of the crew has been great and the gluten free meal I ordered was excellent. I didn't think I'd be writing such a negative review of an Emirates flight given their outstanding reputation however, I feel as consumers we shouldn't just purchase slick TV adverts, it's important we share our experiences, both good and bad and make informed decisions as to which airline to fly with in the future.I'm flying back to Manchester with Emirates this coming Wednesday and I'm hopeful of a better experience. Kind regards, Gary Novak"
881,"We paid for upgraded seats, however due to a change in the aircraft type we couldn't have the seats we had paid for. This isn't a problem, however, Emirates haven't yet refunded me my money that I paid for the upgrade and we are a month after the flight. A Massey"
882,My flight has got cancelled and changed to another time by Emirates. I have to fly back earlier...cut short by 5 hours. The reason I paid for the ticket because I want the late return flight. I'm upset with the 2nd time taking Emirates flight.
883,"A trip turned nightmareI had the most horrifying experience flying with Emirate. I flew Emirate with my 2 years old son from New Zealand via Australia- Dubai- Lagos in July and September 2018. My child car seat got missing on arrival to my destination and up till now, the missing car seat issue has not been resolved despite all my effort by calling and writing several emails. That aside, our flight back from Lagos was a nightmare, the untrained ground staffs were very unprofessional with the way they were handling passengers in Lagos. Passengers were spoken to rudely, shoved rudely when checking in.I and my 2 years old son were denied boarding at the boarding gate after check in simply because I was asked to reduce an excess of 1 kg hand luggage ( My son's food ) which I complied to and in the process of disposing items from my hand luggage to fit in his food into my hand luggage, the gate was shut and we were not allow to board ! I could not believe it!Who would treat a woman with a child that way? Flying to New Zealand from Nigeria with a 2 years old son and denied boarding at the boarding gate.  A 2 days flight for that matter!  I was devastated, I had no money, nowhere to go to for the night and the most annoying thing was that the airline staff ignored us with no apology or explanation. We were 2 women with children that were denied boarding! My son was crying, hungry cold and caught a fever from the horrid experience.I thought I was dealing with professionals but as far as I am concern, Emirate staffs were the worst I have ever encountered. We paid a huge sum of about $3000 to get another flight the next day! I complained to their customer service and got the usual rhetoric response from them.I was denied boarding and my baby car seat went missing all on one trip. What a nightmare.My experience is the worst ever and Never again would I fly Emirate even if it is the only Airline available. I will keep off people that do not know how to treat humans"
884,"Code share with Qantas, so you will pay around double to travel with Emirates and end up on a flight you could get for half the price. The service is still as bad though, and if you run into any trouble on the flight don’t expect any help from this lot. Useless."
885,"Travelled with my husband from London to Singapore on Emirates in Business Class via Dubai in September 2018.  The flight from London to Dubai was on an Airbus A380-300.  Good seats but the cabin crew were a nightmare.  My husband's drinks order was taken when we got on board but no drink appeared so my husband reminded the crew member of this and she just giggled and walked away with no apology.  They kept getting our food and drinks orders wrong throughout the flight.  My husband ordered some beef sandwiches and a beef PIE was plonked down in front of him and the crew member argued with him that that was what he ordered.  I heard what my husband ordered and it was not a beef pie.  Late in the flight I ordered some sandwiches and a scone.  The sandwiches came but the scone didn't.  I told a crew member this and she practically threw a scone at me and told me that I had to eat it quickly as the flight would shortly be landing.  The business class interior of the Airbus is very cheap looking.  It's faux wood plastic panels.  All the crew on this flight seem to want to do is to hang around the bar at the back of the cabin.  We flew from Dubai to Singapore on a Boeing 777 300ER again in business class, the sleeper seats are so narrow and uncomfortable but the in flight service was better on this sector.  They don't give out amenity kits any more I was told by the crew which I found to be very cheap given how much this flight had cost us in business class.  I wrote to Emirates telling them all this but they just sent me an email full of meaningless platitudes.  Not impressed with Emirates at all.  Can't see that we'd ever use them again."
886,"I’m quite surprised that Emirates has got only 2 stars. Flying a lot with different companies, I think it’s one of the best especially when it comes to the economy class service. Always enough place for the legs, good food. They don’t sell emergency exit seats like others. I flew to China with them several times and never had any problems. The cabin crews are also always polite and helpful."
887,"A failing or two by a company can be overlooked, but our four flights (Newcastle to Tokyo via Dubai, return) were a catalogue of the worst possible service.On the first leg we found that, despite paying for allocated seats, we were reallocated to less desirable seats (without being informed). The seats were cramped. So that was a rip off by Emirates. On the same leg,  passengers were paralytic drunk, vomiting, and spilling wine over us. Yet Emirates continued serving alcohol. If there had been an emergency, many of the passengers would have been unable to evacuate the plane efficiently. A serious safety issue.On the second leg there was nothing so awful, but the number of toilets were inadequate, (with several being taken out of service): for most of the flight there were queues, often 15 minutes long, for toilets.No chance of taking time to clean teeth and freshen up. The staff gave the impression of barely being able to acknowledge the existence of the passengers who paid their salariesOn the first return leg the same problem arose with the toilets. The staff were unbelievably rude, totally ignoring passengers on boarding. The food, which on the previous leg had been poor, but edible, was largely completely inedible, the worst airline food I have ever seen. I had asked for vegan food, and am quite relaxed if my needs can't be met. I was given a meal which was announced as vegetarian;I asked if it were in fact vegan. The staff member then muttered  ""it's the same thing"" and then, unbelievably, threw it at me. It was in fact (inedible) vegan. The staff did not even try to collect our rubbish, so we had to take it off the plane and find a waste bin. And many more small failings by the crew. The worst crew I have ever come across in hundreds of flights.The fourth leg was a pleasant surprise. Relaxed, pleasant crew, excellent food, comfortable seats. I don't  understand how there could be such a variation."
888,"Emirates Airlines - Been using this airline since 2009 about six long flights a year along with my wife,!!!!!!!   If you get an offer of cheap Skywards miles don't take it up as the flights you can use them on usually have special offer upgrades (under half price) when the flight opens for check in.Great airbourne experience, Absolutely lousy booking and customer service, cost me several hundred pounds to correct their mistakes on their booking site and by their staff. To make matters worse this was a special holiday for our wedding anniversary!!!!!No amount of complaining has achieved any offer of compensation and they now refuse to even communicate with me. Even a signed for letter has gone unanswered.In respect of their Bookin sytems and staff and especially Customer Affairs / Services Emirates show utter contempt for their customers."
889,"If there was 0 stars I would have given it. Appalling cabin service, inedible food followed up by no customer service and misogynistic staff at Dubai airport. They make Ryanair and Easyjet look like luxury airlines. Never Again!!"
890,"Outstanding customer care, professional and dedicated crew.Very pleased with the service."
891,"Awful service - Cancelling my frequent flyer membershipWe fly Sydney to Dublin twice a year for the past 10years and preferred Emirates but I will never fly with them again. Over the past two years we’ve noticed deteriorating service but this last trip was unacceptable. The plane was dated, seats threadbare, dirty and extremely uncomfortable, food was not just minimal but disgusting, staff were rude and argued among themselves in front of customers. Then our flight out of Sydney was delayed resulting in us missing the connecting flight hence having to add an 8hr layover in Dubai to our 24hr flight. We were issued new boarding passes but my husband and I were no longer seated together, ground staff in Dubai were incredibly rude and unhelpful and to top it off all we were given was a meal voucher (limited to a cheeseburger burger meal or equivalent from a coffee shop) thanks a whole lot!!! Clearly being a loyal customer means nothing, we will never set foot on Emirates flights again."
892,"Just come back from a trip to Dubai flying with Emirates. This is the best airline I have ever been on. Everything was excellent - the food, the flight and the comfort. Highly recommended. Can't wait to fly again!"
893,"Flown a number of times now with Emirates, the last one being a week ago and have had no problems whatsoever with them. The flight times are generally good with lots of choice, cost is not excessive, staff friendly, seats comfy and more roomy than average in economy and the food is good too."
894,Took a flight with Emirates with my wife. Spent $5000 in tickets. They damaged my luggage due to negligence and I lost items because the lock broke off. $1000 bag damaged with a sharp object probably from being slammed in to something. Did all the paperwork and reported as per regulation. Now they’re offering me $100 for a brand new bag worth $1000 that they destroyed. Looking to take legal action. Been chasing for months with nothing coming to fruition. AVOID.
895,"On the 4th of July when I had to go for my brothers wedding in Denmark together with my 6-month-old daughter. I went to my flydubai plane in Entebbe, Uganda, that i had booked through Emirates, (it seems like there is some cooperation since I did not choose to fly with FlyDubai) they refused me even to enter the airport for my flight. They said they already closed. My departure was at 22:10 and I was there at 21:00 exactly. I was late, but they were supposed to still take in people for another ten minutes before they should close at 21:10, exactly one hour before departure. I begged ro enter and showed them the time but they did not want to hear. I asked what to do and they told me to wait until the airplane had departed and then go the office of Emirates in the airport. After the flight had departed I went to the flydubai office since there was no people in the airport's Emirates office. Ten other people had also missed the same flight and all were angry since they had also been there before closing time. The man at the office told us all that they could not do anything and that I would have to go to the Emirates office in Kampala the following day to see what they could do.I went there and they told me I had to pay a new ticket even more expensive than the first one for me and my baby. I was very disappointed because I did not have that money. I decided to use another company to order a one way ticket to Copenhagen since i knew that I would still be able to use my Emirates return ticket. They never told me in the Emirates office that when I missed the departing flight it  would also influence my return. When it was about the date of my return to Uganda I could not find the ticket online anymore.  I called Emirates help line and I was told that I cannot use my return as well! I was now stuck in Denmark with my baby and could not go back to my husband, because I already lost a lot of money since I already bought two tickets in one month - I did not have enough money to buy a new return ticket. I was told by Emirates to write a complaint on the Emirates website and I did so. However they said that it could take up to 30 days to get a reply. After about three weeks waiting with no answer to my case, I had my salary and decided to purchase another one way ticket from another company for our family to be reunited and in order to be able to return back to my job responsibilities in Uganda.On the 8th of August I finally received a decision from Emirates when I had already returned to my family. They told me by email that there was no way they could do anything for, me, help me or get me a refund. Their reason was that I did not have enough prove of the time I arrived at the airport in Uganda!Yet they never mentioned their bad service: the fact that they never told me that my return also had expired and that I was not just able to pay a penalty fee and rebook my ticket on the same day as my flight for 100$ as I know is the normal procedure of Emirates.I lost more than a months salary through this plus had a lot of stress.I have been using Emirates a lot earlier, been their member and been okay, but this time I have been treated without respect. I am very disappointed.Maybe Emirates, should also check its cooperation with Flydubai. When ten people miss the same plane it could be a sign that something is very wrong! Take care if you use Emirates - if you get in to trouble they will just tell you sorry, but it seems like they are terrible in doing anything about it!"
896,"I love Emirates!! By far the best airline I have flown with. I have used Emirates on many occasions since 2006, and every now and again I have flown with other airlines but none of them live up to the standards of Emirates. I'm looking forward to my next flight with them"
897,"Expired purée from Emirates got my son really sick been flying with emirates past 5 years  , i am skyward member , I cannot  describe how disappointed i am when they gave me expired purée to feed my child and only for them to only defend themselves !!Was traveling 23 August 2018 to USA holiday with my husband and our son , and the purée was dated May 2018 . he really started throwing up and runny tummy but assumed it’s because of flying . Sickness stopped after 3days in New York , anyways this is very long story and  I am writing here so  I can warn anyone traveling with babies or who is planning to travel with Emirates with their baby to watch out.I did send them a long email complaining about what my baby went through after eating expired purée and only for them to respond after 1 month and only responded with there is no way that could happen , so basically denied everything. I was traveling in August 2018 and the purée expired May 2018. And I have proof .For the parents out there please double check everything thing or best bring your own food for your child. I know long flights can be so tiring and babies get irritated and you do anything you can to get them to sleep, so you can rest too. Emirates has changed they use to be good and friendly but not the staff is really rude . I really wonder what’s going now !"
898,"myself and my family was traveling to Dubai and it was a very special holiday as it was a time for us to celebrate my mother getting through breast cancer and also it was my daughters 3rd birthday. we prebooked the upper deck as was advised it was better and nicer to travel this way, we paid extra then we would have paid for lower deck which was fine when we arrived at the airport we was told the aeroplane had been changed last minute and I was to call for my refund which when traveling with 3 young children is a hectic time let alone having to call to to get a refund. They never offered any nice gesture for their problem Just shrugged their shoulders and told me there Is no more they can do and was told that they have the right to change the seats at any time. (what would be the point of allowing to prebook if this is the case) I did receive my refund but I had to keep checking my account whilst on my holiday.once I got to my destination my buggy hood had been snapped in transit which was very frustrating while on holiday with no hood for sun protection for my daughter. I feel like its more hassle and hard work to me to travel with emirates again!"
899,"The best company in the world. I fly with Emirates for all my travels, the best service."
900,"they play with customers !!! i think they are not doing good business .Emirates are now working together with FZ.They claim that they are in partnership with them .When you need something in connection with them they say they are not in partnership with them ...pls decide that is your role and I am sad that you are now in venture with FZ which is a bad company and far from EK.The customers get no food , drinks something that they are used with ek .You can not sell apples with bananas !!!!if you don't cover the destination rather not sell it as sell it and you have angry customers .we have party of 12 pax and they have to waith in dxb more than 10 hours due to bad connection / only connection available to get to KTM .they are not entitled to htl .as this is ek /fz combination .EK should cover the costs of acommodation ."
901,"Today Emirates helped sending an Afghan refugee family with two small children (youngest 2 years old) back to a death penalty for the  whole family in Afganistan. Emirates was informed by this through several phone calls, but chose to go through with the deportation. It happened today Thursday 9th October 2018 with at flight leaving 15.35 from Copenhagen Airport to Dubai."

903,"Appalling service from uninformed operatives, or maybe they were just rude. Don’t expect help from them"
904,"Emirates used to be a good airline.  but over the years they have got worse and worse.  to the point where i dont even fly with them anymore. they had technical issues on an aircraft in maldives, they kept us at the airport for like 8 hours without food or water, when they finally gave us vouchers, we could only use it for a drink or a sandwich not both!!!then  put us up in horible hotels, lost a night in dubai (for which i had already prepaid for my transfer and hotel), seeing as we were on our honeymoon this really messed us up. emirates didnt compensate us at all.  i sent multiple emails to their directors and customer service team but got nothing. gave us some worthless skyward miles and fobbed us off."
905,The flight got us from A to B but the service was slow. I had no drink offered when we got onto the flight. As economy passengers your left to do things on your own. My flight was from Heathrow to Dubai on the 13th September 2018
906,"I’ve travelled many airlines long haul London to Australia and Emirates and Cathy Pacific have been best. Most recent flight back in May Emirates staff in Melbourne were excellent. I had to change my flight plans twice, no fuss, no problems, even when last change was less than 24hrs before flight. Good planes, good service, will travel with them again and again."
907,"On May 21st 2018. I have purchased return tickets for Zagreb – Dubai – Colombo route on Emirates web site (Emirates.com). I have subsequently received e-tickets on my email and confirmation of payment.On July 26th, I have received the text message on my cell phone that the terms and conditions of the flight have changed and, after contacting Zagreb office, I was informed that this company is no longer flying from Zagreb. I was further instructed that our flight will be handled by low cost airline Fly Dubai and that I can direct all complaints to your regional contact center.I have called the contact center and complained that I am getting a lower quality service than the one I paid originally: less quality aircraft 737 – 800 (738) V1 instead of originally confirmed Boeing 777-300ER (77W) Three Class, meals, extra luggage weight, free seat choices and free entertainment content. I was offered the choice of these services instead of my original flight or a refund.I still believe that the compensation of service is nowhere near what we originally purchased with Emirates. If we wanted to fly the low cost airlines, we would have purchased those tickets in the first place but we simply wanted to fly with Emirates for the quality of the service. I still cannot believe that this company - the company voted best airline in 2017. – is handling my situation so poorly!Still no answer"
908,"I used to think they are a good airline but that all changed after my experience in Istanbul Turkey. Emirates staff in Istanbul were very arrogant. They assaulted me, lost my lugagge and cancelled my ticket.  The staff did not speak good English and all they could do is shout. Expect better from reputable airline like Emirates. They need to learn to speak to customers with respect and also respect women.I had the worst experience ever and will never use them again."
909,"Recent shocking and horrible experience flying with Emirates recently. Firstly tried to call them numerous times as just a day before my flight my Partner had a bad accident, where one person or another kept saying yes we will sort but never ever did. Again I had further issues at the airport. Firstly the link they sent me did not open nor did I get a reply from this email when flagged. Then when we got to the airport the lady who checked us in stated to go to the lounge for us to receive the Wheelchair - when we got there I was absolutely disgusted by the service where the lady stated we cannot help you with this and said she didn’t have a clue on this service, so My Partner was in even more pain and agony as he had to have this lengthy walk. He suffered a lot on the flight as no leg room seat was neither provided. This is not at all the service I expect from Emirates or any other airline and I am absolutely appalled whereby, if this is not looked into with seriousness. We then decided not to take the flight back with you and did not use our return tickets. Ive added this posting as it is critical to make further customers, family and friends aware of this matter.  They have not given us a refund on our return tickets and the customer service has been awful-will never be flying with them again"
910,"I was due to travel to dubai in january 2019 with my partner first time with emirates. I booked 2 business class flight over the phone with emirates office in london, few days later me and my partner decided we couldnt afford to go on business it costed us alot of money. so i called up the emirates asking to downgrade the flight. i was transfered to someone in india, the man on the phone said i wont be able to downgrade what i will need to do is cancel my flight and request a refund. i was asked to fill a request form online and send it off.  so i tried to do it online it did not work so the man said he will do it on my behalf over the phone . at that moment the man did not once say or tell me that there will be massive charges if i wish to cancel the flight and £1,000 will get deducted from my refund. i was told it will take 15 working days for my refund. i got a email back after 16 days saying i will get £1,000 deducted for the refund. i called the office at least 40 times throughout the month trying to get my full refund but still nothing.  i was told the manager will call me back but no one called back with the right details, apparently their refund department is based in dubai and i cant personally contact them.  after all the phone call investigation i been told i will only get £600 back and not the £1,000 and it will take another 15 to 20 days.  and today i received a email stating i will only get back £400. I'm so frustrated and annoyed with their false info and lies. they are fraud the office in india mumbai is terrible their customer services is poor they have no knowledge about the product and how to engage with customers. i'm utterly dissapointed it left me with a no choice but to write to the chariman of emirates."
911,"Great food, very helpfull staff. They even took a picture of our familiy and gave it to us as a suvenir."
912,"Just few words re Costumer ServiceI have booked holiday package with Emirates Holiday   based on good experience as frequent flyer with Emirates Airline,As  turns out when reviewing  booking confirmation and after paying for booking our family was due to check out from one of Thailand Hotels 18 hours before flights back home.I have rang info line and to start  which no waiting minutes/hours wasted for someone to pick up call, agent answered withing 2 min from the call start.Secondly Agent who answer me (Rachel D’Souza ) was what I exactly  expect and look for from Service Agents.She allowed me to explain issue in question without interruptions and usual for info line agents careless  approach.Without getting in to details she offered me few options for me to choose for most suitable solutions for our family problem regarding 18h waiting time after check out from Holiday Resort.What struck me is that when I refused to take any of offered solutions she went back to shift manager with very short '' I put  you on hold for the moment ''   and came back with most desire option to sort  problem we outlined( rescheduled flights with no cost to our family) alsoRachel contacted Hotel direct for my Best Available Sunny Room request from my wife , makes sure I have all transportation arrangement sorted for travel in between airports and final destination etc etc I have experience one of the best costumers service experience I have for quite some time.Well done to you Rachel and  to Emirates Holiday for  keeping Emirate's Airline customer orientated  high standardsLook forward to my departed flight date  and my First Package Holiday with Emirate's  as usually we travel with  Thomson/Tui packages"
913,"AVOID!!!! rude staff, dirty plane, inedible food. no option to purchase snacks for our children. no duty free. on our second flight of the day with them we werent offered ANY drink for 2 hours 20mins. we were very dehydrated. it was like flying 20 years ago! we had to endure 4 flights with them and each was equally as bad. i was expecting superb flights with emirates! ive had far better flights on the tui dreamliner. we wouldnt fly with emirates ever ever again even for free. after complaining when i returned home, their customer service was equally as bad as the flights = disgusting"
914,"I flew from Japan to Azerbaijan and I had 19 extra kilos. At the airport, the airline staff charged me for $768 (84740 Yen), whereas it costs $570 with taxes. They forced me to pay almost $200 more than I supposed. In the beginning, I did not want to pay this amount of money as it did not seem reasonable to me. The worst side of the situation was that I did not have internet connection on my phone so I could check online the official price for extra luggage. However, because of the staff's English proficiency, our communication went slowly and she couldn't provide me with legal information about a fee for extra weight. At the end, there was almost 1,5 hour left to departure time, therefore, I agreed to pay as quickly as I can and to end that never-ending issue. I complained online about it after my arrival and still waiting for the reply. It is the most HORRIBLE experience I have ever had. When I used THY I paid $160 for an extra 20 kilos or less. In Emirates it is more than $500 and the service I got doesn't worth it at all. I disappointed deeply and strongly encourage you not to use Emirates airline for your travel."
915,I'm a tough Japan trained marker businessman and we have travelled with Emirates quite a bit - annually. My wife and I had booked a return Europe trip but the 3.15pm Singapore to Brisbane sector was bought forward by 5hours ruining our family day meeting in Singapore. I sent 4 lots of illuminating feedback online asking to switch to the 8pm same day flight all unsuccessful and was about to switch to Etihad or Qatar for next year's flight booking. BUT I wanted a face to face refusal before I ditched Emirates so went to the Brisbane Emirates office and an outstanding  Natasha and her assistant resolved our problem and restored our faith in humanity and Emirates.
916,"Only on the way down they disappointed me, they brought the welcome drink only about an hour later, although we reached the altitude and had no turbulence.Then you think the flight gets better, it only got worse. One after the other went to the bathroom. Only I was directed back to take a seat, but after me at least 10 more people went to the bathroom, they were not back certain. Are you kidding me? There was no reason just to send me back because I behaved decently as always. Never again emirates and you should do it all, also for political reasons .... Boycott from now on"
917,What an *^% of customer services at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3!!The customer services team at Heathrow Terminal is shambolic and totally unprofessional when it comes to welcoming an economy class customer in emirates lounge even if it can delay the flight when a customer is in need or has special needs or even requesting for a place to offer prayers 5 minutes prior to closing of the gate.I would specially like to mention the name of customer service assistant “Sajad” at heathrow T3 desk who was not only unsympathetic to special needs of myself but was very rude and totally unprofessional in dealing with request to offer prayer or even get a glass of water as I ran out of breath because of my special condition. Such people should never be allowed to interact with people let alone be a customer service assistant at so claimed top airline in the world! Pathetic!
918,"My wife was  asked twice to remove our child from the floor but as she explained to the cabin crew on each occasion the food trays were out and obstructing her from removing the child safely from the floor. On each occasion she asked the cabin crew involved to please remove the trays so she could remove the child from the floor. The Cabin crew involved refused stating that the tray removal service has not started. Eventually my wife managed to remove all the trays and went to hand them into Alix who refused to take them and told my wife to put the on the floor. Later when Alix came around she asked my 6 old child abruptly to hand her the trays from the floor. This was not acceptable.I have details of independent  passengers who witnessed this appalling behaviour by Alix if you would like me to pass their details on i would be happy to.  I could forward this email address on with reference numbers to reply to the incident directly.These passengers advised us to put in a formal complaint to Emirates. My issue is the horrible attitude of Alix and her general behaviour towards me personally was unacceptable, I was sat in the seat behind my wife and never once intervened between my wife and Alix conversations.I am sure Alix has had Complaints made against her judging by my experience there was no need for here to be rude to me throughout the complete flight.Her manager (Emily Bourne) was covering for her by passing on the wrong name details on every occasion spelling me out ""Alice"" more that 3 times, I had to find another cabin crew member on the other side of the plane to get the correct name ""ALIX"" . Alix removed her name badge proving she was aware of her behaviour towards us being detrimental.My wife is more concerned about my child's safety than the cabin crew. This whole charade escalated when the cabin crew (Alix) refused to remove 3 trays to give some access to my wife in order to remove the child. This issue is of the utmost importance to me, I would like disciplinary action against Alix and her manager Emily Bourne for lying to me on 3 separate occasion despite me giving her a chance to be honest and when I asked why Alix's name badge has been removed she told me ""Go find her and ask her yourself!"" but Alix kept avoiding me for the last 1 of the flight i never saw her again"
919,"I have been An Emirates Silver for 4 years now and flew them long flights once to three times a month. They have never upgraded me... not even one time. I have even talked to people who had no status at all that were upgraded before me as well as been on flights that had empty business class seats while I sat in coach. The airline itself has been degrading over the last few years but the rewards program is one of the worst in the airline business. I have recently changed airlines and I am very happy. I still fly Emirates on occasion due to routing and price and I am very glad I changed airlines. I still fly enough to maintian my silver status but still, I receive no benefits from it."
920,"Awful airline, Was amazing a long time ago. Now it is cheap and a very uncomfortable experience. I won't be surprised if other airlines begin to take Emirates market share. I was a customer for the best part of 20 years but now I have switched to a better airline who care for their customer experiences."
921,This airline's service is the worst I've ever encountered. I've flown them twice business class and economy. This airline left my suitcase in Dubai for 2 days and brought it back damaged. They had no apology let alone offer a replacement . Very rude customer service.
922,"Do not fly with this airline. In advance, I asked Emirates if I could take two small sealed batteries in my hand luggage. They said I could. I made sure they were properly wrapped, labeled, terminals protected and documented. The batteries were small, not lithium, and they were stamped by the manufacturer as IATA Approved and suitable for air travel. I followed all the rules 100%. At London Heathrow I once again asked the check-in agent if it was OK to take them in my hand luggage. I explained and she said no problem. But once I got to Dubai I had to connect to my second Emirates flight. It was at that point when an Emirates supervisor said I could not take them and they had to be discarded. I tried to explain but the supervisor would not listen. The other Emirates staff said they were acceptable and that the supervisor was wrong to say no. But there was nothing they could do and nothing I could do. They had to be discarded. Upon return to the UK I filed a written complaint to Emirates. They just keep coming back with lies and excuses trying to pass the blame onto others and not themselves. They have treated my issue pretty poorly. I was a business class passenger with two others and our seats cost just over £12k. But they couldn't care less. So I will now file a claim in the UK small claims court and drag them through the litigation system to get the cost of the new replacement batteries I have had to buy. Maybe some compensation too due to the loss of use of scuba equipment that they were meant to be powering on the 10 night trip to the Maldives. I do not recommend this airline to anyone and I would never, never use them again."
923,I asked for refund on flights that I have booked in October they can easily sell them. Want to charge me £300 per passenger for cancellation on a not for to fly medical note disgraceful don’t fly with emirates.
924,"Never had a problem traveling with this airline, one of the best in business."
925,Recently had a holiday in dubai with emirates booked a meet and great service well worth it driver got us to are hotel safe and sound very careful driver.Hotel was top notch the Lapita fee tickets to theme park all in all a very pleasant holiday would book with Emirates again
926,"Months after booking flights and numerous requests from me and the travel agent, they have not refunded the airline passenger duty for my 12 year old daughter's ticket, denying having received requests, despite being shown proof!!! Incompetent at best, thieves at worst!"
927,"I had to pay a fee to leave Cebu airport in the Philippines which Emirates did not inform me about, nor did they say it wasnt included in my flight price. So, just to be clear, I would not have been allowed to come home if I didn’t pay this fee. I also had no cash and the fee was cash only, so I was forced to withdraw money at the airport, which incurred a cash withdrawal fee as I was using a UK debit card. The return flight experience wasn’t great. My girlfriend and I were starving because they served the food towards the end of the flight due to us being at the back row. They could not put this down to turbulence as there wasn’t any. I was refused a drink towards the start of the flight as they mentioned they would serve it later with the meal, which of course didn’t come till late so we were dehydrated. All of the above has been sent to the complaints team of Emirates and they concluded that they were unable to assist with this concern and the case was then closed.  Very unprofessional inflight and with their customer service center. Do not book with this airline unless it’s your only choice of getting to where you want to go."
928,Not even gone on my flight yet due to go tomorrow & not started well. I booked a surprise trip for my husband's 50th birthday a whole year ago to Maldives & was recommended to fly Emirate's. Received email about checking in only for them to give me seats in aisle 61 & 88 with no option to change seats. This is a dream trip and spoke to online chat & was not helpful at all. Never again & I haven't even flown yet so upset
929,"Excellent trip to the far east, very comfortable on their double decker plane in the economy class.Highly recommended!"
930,"Was great, now ripoff artists. Becoming the budget/Ryan airlines of the middle East. Just charged me £40 pounds to pick my seats and charged separately for each leg of the flight. Last time I was charged $50 for being two kilos over the carry on allowance when boarding at Dubai for my connecting flight. Wasn't an issue when I boarded in London but when you're checked bag is already away and you have done a small amount of duty free shopping and have no choice but to pay or not get on your flight, that's when they get you. Have used them for 15 years regularly but thoroughly fed up now. Only using them this time because I have no other choice."
931,Superb ___ world wide service Comfort and punctuality 100% The price increases on special event which shouldn't be.
932,"One of the worse customer service I ever encountered in my whole life. Requested to change my name on my online profile in order to match my passport. The customer service asked me to send request to their team but told me since my name has special character so it's not gonna work. The so call 'special character' is only a hyphen. Asked further assistant, but Valentina, the customer service is still asking to fill the form. She also left the conversation without notice. Absolutely rude and time waster. Will never used Emirates again if their customer service is like this."
933,"Whilst in Emirate's care from Thailand to Gatwick my suitcase was damaged beyond repair. I have had to pack our suitcase and send it, forward ticket details and photographs. After emails, phone calls and more we were offered £76,  much less than half the cost of a similar standard case, to buy a new one from prescribed retailers. And K2 Global (to whom we were referred) have refused to return our original case. Now Emirates wants the original receipt for the case despite it being clearly branded Antler. many wasted hours and seriously out of pocket through no fault of our own."
934,"Emirates have joined the ""Rip em off club"" with the likes of Ryanair etc.How? by charging for seat reservations on all flights including onward ones to reach your destination. What next, paying to use the toilets............?Money grabbers!"
935,"Prior to flying with Emirates we were told nothing but good things. “Best airline in the world” they said.Now brace yourselves, because you shall now hear the truth behind the marketing hype...Flying with Emirates is no better than any other large commercial airline.In fact, in our experience it fell far below the standards we were used to receiving on other airlines e.g. British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines etc. Some of the main areas where Emirates falls below standards are:1. Customer service - cabin crew rushed through the motions as quickly as possible, at times there was lack of visibility of them and when they did appear mistakes were made e.g being asked the same thing more than once by different crew members, missing items when being served. 2. Aircraft standards - we flew in what looked like a very old A380 that hadn’t been well maintained. The touch screen entertainment systems were difficult to use being old touch screen technology, material on the seats were frayed and loose. We later flew on a newer aircraft for the second part of our journey but the only upgrade was a touch screen that worked. The quality and standard of the cabin were common and not what was expected when viewing their advertisements which boasts its got the best economy class with no need of being upgraded. 3. Entertainment options - I spent half of a 4 hour flight just trying to decide what to watch. Yes, Emirates do have a large selection of movies but they cater to a wide range of audiences instead of being mainstream movies. I settled for one new Hollywood movie which I hadn’t already seen and had actually heard of, the rest of the movies I watched were an exploration of another culture & language.4. Food - airline food isn’t usually the best, but Emirates in particular didn’t have very good options and overall didn’t taste great. In 4 flights I saw “chicken, mash potato and carrots” appear on the menu twice and could only imagine how bland that would be. When rejected the offer for food the cabin crew would seem very confused and shocked by my response.5. The flight - bumpy, loud ambiguous noises. We practically crash landed back at Heathrow. I don’t like flying as it is, this was like flying EasyJet.A situation happened during our first ever flight with emirates which explains the nature of how this airline operates and treats its passengers. After boarding and fastening our seatbelts, it took 45 minutes before the aircraft actually took off which delayed our journey by 30 minutes where we (and around 20+ other passengers on the flight) had limited time to connect to another flight in Dubai. No cabin crew were visible and there was no communication from the pilot to explain reasons for the delay, or that we would land late in Dubai.Once we landed, we only had 30 minutes to get to the next flight. Instead 20+ of us were told to move to a corner by Emirates ground staff and wait. No explanation was given, we weren’t being told what would happen next.We decided to approach the Emirates connection desk where there was even more lack of communication. The staff instead decided to tell my wife that she needs to be quiet when she was just asking important questions about how we continue our journey! I straight away asked for a manager.Instead of a Manager, a Supervisor appeared and rudely asked what the problem is. I told his staff member to explain the situation rather than me go through it all again. He pulled out a letter for Copthorne Hotel and forced this upon us telling us we need to stay there because there isn’t another flight for another 9 hours.We didn’t see the point going to and from a hotel that we didn’t want to stay in and wanted to know how we would be compensated for the 9 hour delay to our journey and holiday that Emirates had caused. He told us that we are economy and therefore we should only expect a Copthorne hotel to stay in for the delay and if we wanted to query compensation then we would have to email their complaints team. He told us we would find out the outcome in 24 hours. So far it has been a week and the only response we have received from Emirates is to say that they would come back to us within 30 days! He also told us that we should have read the terms and conditions of flying with Emirates before we can expect compensation, well we have done and it mentions delays caused where Emirates was not directly at fault e.g. adverse weather, technical failure... well we hadn’t been told the reason but I’m sure we would know if there was something so severe!Never flying Emirates again, I’ll stick with airlines that are reliable, treat their customers with care and respect and offer comfort."
936,"Emirates is one of my favorite companies to fly with! Used them a couple of times over the past two years and their onboard service has always been excellent! Gotta highlight one of the stewardesses - Carina from Brazil, I met her on my last flight and she made my long flight so much better! Thank you ..."
937,Well a month after returning to the UK I still have a damaged case. Customer service is non-existent! Would never fly with this company again!
938,"Not the airline everyone suggested it was. Prior to flying Emirates for the first time, I had been told nothing but good things. Firstly, I normally fly Singapore Airlines/Cathay Pacific when flying East so have experienced nothing but the best level of customer service etc. On the flight out with Emirates the first thing that I noticed was how poor the meals were. Possibly the worst I've ever come across with an airline, even budget ones and I'm not fussy when it comes to food. The breakfast consisted of two pieces of broccoli, two medium sized potato wedges, sliced carrots with bread, water and a small desert. It was barely edible. I had a connection in DXB and opted to skip meals on a couple of the flights as it just got worse. After the first meal my partner opted not to eat on any of the flights. As I am tall, I prepaid for extra legroom seats for me and my partner at an extra £600 in total for four flights. On the return flight, we had to reschedule our flight through no fault of our own and got to the airport early to ensure we still got the extra legroom seats. The check in staff advised us they could only offer myself extra legroom and not my partner as there was only one available. Upon boarding the first flight, we noticed 3 extra legroom seats still available right next to myself. They were then offered to the taller people on the flight and even though I'd paid for one of them, to avoid a commotion I just let it go and let the people sit there. On the second flight, even though I'd been advised I'd been allocated the extra leg room seat, upon boarding I could see that it wasn't, it was the seat just behind (a standard seat) great discomfort for someone who stands at 6'7. Upon returning home, I contacted Emirates for a refund for the seats we never received. They stated there was nothing they could do, as they offered us the seats on our original booking, and it was through no fault of their own that we had to reschedule the flight. They showed absolutely no compassion, and were happy to take an extra £600 on top of flights that already cost £1300 for a service they didn't provide. The time spent in the extra legroom seats did allow me to observe and listen to the staff. On each flight was a similar attitude. None of them liked working for Emirates and all discussed how they couldn't wait to move on from the company. It showed in their work. I observed them kicking plastic cups/rubbish instead of picking them up. They weren't very forthcoming with beverages. I watched a piece of rubbish be dropped by the toilets early on in the flight and sat and watched how many times members of staff would walk past it without picking it up. It was at least 30 times. Something you'd never witness on the likes of Singapore Airlines. Prior to flying I repeatedly saw the commercial where customers approach the check-in desk asking for an upgrade and the commercial advises that there is no need as Emirates boasts some of the best economy seats in the world. This is not the case. It was standard seats on an aged plane. No different than economy seats on any other plane.Moral of the story, don't believe the hype, Emirates invests a lot of money into marketing, maybe some of that money should be invested back into their staff/planes."
939,"NOT impressed one bit!....checked in online in Dubai at hotel (had prepaid for 6 seats, same ones as outbound journey). Check in showed them as correct. Took suitcase to DXB & get boarding passes printed. Didn't check passes as pre paid seats and check in had already confirmed them. When I looked at passes at boarding gate 'ground operative' had moved  ALL 6 of us back 20 rows?????Where's my £130.00?????? for prepaid seats you changed without asking me.STILL WAITING FOR REPLY?????? 8 days later.I get the impression from reviews below that Emirates hope if they leave you long enough you'll forget about the complaint....ABTA or ATOL....hmmm"
940,TWO-FACED HUSTLERSEmirates Vacations Representatives are nothing but two-faced hustlers! It is the worse customer service experience I’ve ever had. It has been nothing but lies and more lies. I followed their complaint escalation procedure and requested a call or email from management but instead I keep getting calls from the same booking idiot who butchered my vacation. STAY AWAY! It’s not worth the aggravation.
941,"Flew from Seychelles - Kathmandu with a stop-over in Dubai. Very smooth check-in, transfer and collection of baggage, polite staff. Both flights were under booked and passengers were spaced out so that we had 2-3 seats each and could easily sleep! Will be using Emirates again."
942,"I recently traveled from IAD (Washington Dulles International Airport) to DEL (New Delhi, India) through DXB (Dubai).Everything looked fine until I reached Dubai Airport (DXB) before gate.My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her immediately Mr. Mohamed (Seemed their Supervisor) came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and started taking to the other side, saying "" let me see now, get him deported"". took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed.He said no it is heavier. I opened the bag and showed that there was nothing in the bag except the laptop. but he was acting really rude and was ignoring what I was showing him on ticket documents. he said your other bag is also heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that.I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It was just that he was trying to harass me. He was being extremely rude and said he will make sure that my flight is missed. I was really in trauma while dealing with him as it seemed that he was trying that my flight is missed. As I was in a different country I was really afraid. He was not allowing me to go. It looked like that other emirates staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior. One of the staff member who had weighed my luggage earlier and allowed slowly told me that I could complain online about him. I tried to ask his name but I was told that they couldn't tell his name. which later I saw on him uniform that his name was Mohammed. Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the amount whatever additional they charge. I felt it like a ransom. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to still check in my luggage and didn't allow in the flight. I was really depressed after this incident and I was scared about my return flight if somehow this person is there again he may put me in trouble again. He shouldn't have behaved like this. I was surprised why these kind of criminal mentality people are serving in such a service field. I will never take Emirates in future for me and my family, I have also told my friends about this incident and have suggested to not to use Emirates for flights touching Dubai."
943,Ruin My sister Wedding. Due to their staff negligence lost our Baggage all value able items for wedding been lost. Even Important Items like Wedding Day Clothes. Spent our First week on Airport chasing Emirtates Staff. We booked Tickets from U.K call centers are in rest of the world they dont have access fully for all information. No customer Service available in United Kingdom. Dubai Customer Service not helpfull. After ruining my sister wedding they offer half componsenation for items Lost no explanation given just few word from Dubai office this is our company policy. Bottom Line they dont care . will never fly them again . Qatar or Turkish airline will be prefernce now on.I am thinking to open petition against them. if company is making so much money from U.K customer they should be liable and have some sort of office in u.k because Dubai law does not apply here this is why they dont care .
944,Emirates ruined my vacations completely! Had a really awful experience with Emirates. On our way back from Jakarta to Dubai our flight was cancelled and Emirates never notified us. As a result we showed up on time of our original flight only to find out that Emirates moved us to an earlier flight without notifying us! Emirates refused to sit us on another flight and we had to buy new tickets back home all the way from Jakarta to Moscow. Even after that incident for 3 months already I’m struggling to get a confirmation that my flight was cancelled to get a compensation from my travel insurance company. And guess what? For 3 months I encounter the heaviest bureaucracy I’ve seen in years! And zero result. Never again I will fly with Emirates! Beware!
945,Flew to South Africa recently. Was a great trip. Air crew was very friendly and they had awesome films
946,"I booked flights from Bodrum to Dubai with Emirates in November 2017 through Tripsta.  On January 3rd I received an email from Tripsta saying I could transfer to a different flight, (but it was a night flight and would mean paying an extra nights accommodation) or I could cancel the flights.  When I was originally booking my flights, I saw two night flights, which would have been significantly cheaper, but I decided to pay more for the day flights, as I prefer day time travel.   I contacted Emirates to explain that this cancelled flight would cost me an extra £80 for another nights accommodation and that if I'd booked this flight in the first place, it would have been over £100 cheaper, so I asked for compensation.  I was told this was not possible, so I opted to cancel the flights and rebooked with another airline.  This was  now 5 months ago, and I've tried contacting both Tripsta and Emirates numerous times and just keep getting fobbed off.  Tripsta claim that it is Emirates fault as they are still waiting for the refund from them.  (Last email from Tripsta 29th May 2018 "" Kindly note that we have been chasing Emirates Airlines for a long time, but  they have informed us that this is their refund process and there is no way to hurry up their procedure.""  They have informed us that the request is till in progress and they will inform us as soon as the investigation will be closed"". I called Emirates (very unhelpful lady, who just insisted I filled in a complaint form, no sympathy at all) and then I emailed using their complaint form, showing them numerous emails from Tripsta, blaming Emirates for the delay, and all I got back was a response saying I need to go through Tripsta, no apology, no  explanation as to why they had not yet repaid Tripsta.   Very disappointed, as I was very impressed with Emirates when I used them to fly to Thailand.  5 months is not acceptable to be waiting for a refund."
947,"Briefly : Emirates used to be excellent, I am (was) a loyal customer and I have been flying with them for the past 8 years. However, I have noticed a big decline in the quality of their service in the last few years. The price of flying with them has not gone down however. You can easily find an airline just as good for much less.Long version : I have been flying Emirates for long haul has much as possible, several round trips a year for many years. Yes, flying with them is much more expensive than with someone else but it was worth it.Now not so. First of all, the general quality they provide has been going downhill, even in Business Class. My last trip and the reply I got from customer service are what made me lose all faith in them and switch to someone else, whom I will review next month after I fly with them for the first time but it looks promising so far. My last trip: 1) CDG Airport, the counter lady was just awful. She talked to me in a way no one ever did before. No hello, no thank you, just commands ""passport"" ""luggage on the side"". And she didn't even give me the time to carry her orders. I was opening the passport at the appropriate pages to make it easier for her, but after 1 second of telling me to give her my passport she yelled ""I said give me your passport"". Anyways, she gave me my tickets and I left. This is not the worst experience I have with an Emirates counter lady. In 2014 I was going to Phuket from CDG via DXB. I get to the counter and while the lady processes my passport, I take a photo of the screen above her. She was convinced I had taken a photo of her (why would I even want a photo of her??) and she called me names and threatened to sue. She didn't give me back my passport and yanked my phone out of my hands and called her two buddies from security (she was clearly friends with them). They told me to wait while they went through my phone!! After 20 minutes, the flight purser came and gave me back my belonging and escorted me to the gate. Back to my last flight.2) I arrive at my seat, disgusting, stained and full of crumbles. I politely ask the flight attendant if there are any seats left and she said no, the flight was full. I had to deal with my disgusting seat on my own and clean it as best as I could.3) In flight, the crew looked like someone died. I've never seen an Emirates cabin crew like this. In fact, one of my best flying experience was with the cabin crew of a flight from DXB to SIN in Business Class with Emirates.4) DXB to BNE, nothing out of the ordinary until I reach inside the pocket of the seat in front of me to grab the Open Skies magazine and get cut by a crushed plastic glass from a previous flight. Seriously do they not clean their planes anymore? It wasn't bleeding too much so I took care of it myself. Moving on, I got sick 1 hour after eating the in meal flight, I felt really bad so I talked to the flights attended who were genuinely concerned and wrote down my account on a notebook (i saw her write it down with my own eyes). This is not my complaint, everyone knows in flight meals aren't the best and they are known to make people sick, my complaint is with the subsequent customer response I received. After flights :I contacted Customer service and explained all of the above, in a nicer and more detailed way. After more than a month, I receive this answer ""Dear Mr Michael,Having reviewed the details of your flights, unfortunately, I was unable to locate a report completed by the cabin crew, pertaining to your experiences. Nevertheless, I have noted your comments and observations and have conveyed this to our Divisional Senior Vice President Service Delivery for his internal review.May I respectfully suggest that should a similar incident ever occur again, that you request the help of the Purser on board, at the time of the incident.  The Purser is the person in charge of all the cabin crew on the flight, will do all possible to assist, and will be in a position to clarify the situation, and log an official report.Thank you once again for writing and allowing me to respond.  Yours sincerely,  Caroline G*censored****Customer Affairs""That's it, no apologies, and they dare say there is no written account of my sickness of board although I saw the flight attendant write everything down with my own eyes. The only reasons I gave 2 stars and not 1 :1) Like I said, one of my best flight was with Emirates and their amazing cabin crew at the time.2) Their huge fleet of A380s which is my favorite aircraft."
948,"Currently sitting in the Emirates Business lounge in Dubai after the most shocking ever customer experience at Dubai airport. I was travelling from Manchester to Chennai for 2 nights for business meetings and the flight transited through Dubai with only 1 hr transit time which seems to be quit common as my wife and I experienced this last year when we flew business via Dubai for our honeymoon . I got off the Dubai flight at 20.25, and even though the Chennai flight wasn’t departing until 21.00 I was met at the gate to be told I’d missed it and they were going to re-book me on the next flight tomorrow. This flight being suggested turned out to be 24 hrs later and at 21:00 via Bahrain thereby losing a whole day in Dubai and adding a few extra hours going via another location.However, after looking online directly myself, I could see there were 3 earlier flights directly to Chennai, but I was told I couldn’t have a seat on those 3 because they only had business class seats available and they could do nothing to upgrade me. After then going to the Emirate ticket desk and suggesting to pay for a business class or first class ticket I was then told I could go on the 02.45 flight for £650 which I agreed to, When booking, her manager then said this wasn't possible as the price only applied to an upgrade and as I wasn't on the original flight this would not be possible. The next option that was presented to me was a business class ticket for £3,000, even though I could see the seat for sale on the Emirates website for £817 if i just purchased the ticket fresh.I said I would just book it myself and pay the £817 but the manager told me I had to wait while he disassociated the return flights. It took him 20 minutes on hold to the reinvent department and while waiting someone else waiting in the que just went and just purchased the last seat available. He therefore offered me instead a flight back to Manchester at 03.00 as the best solution. So in total I spent two and a half hours at the checking desk and will be spending a further 4 hours in the business class lounge that I was told they couldn’t even give this to me complimentary and I would have to pay $108 myself for this access.The customer service throughout has been disgusting, no courtesy, no empathy and had they told the truth about the business class availability on the other flights sooner I could have taken that option. There is a total disconnect between all their systems and from everything else I heard while waiting it seems all flights are over sold and that is the real cause of all these issues!!!"
949,"Work for Emirates was always my dream until I decided to join for the Open Day delivered in Dublin. The lady responsible for doing the interviews called Theresa really needs to go back to Dubai and go for some customer service classes and some administration classes as well. At the first day of the open day on Friday the 27th, they had larger number of people than they were expecting, and the lady's responsible for doing the interviews wasn't able to handle the situation, the left us standing in a very warm room for nearly 2 hours, and after that they bearly looked at people faces, dind't give a chance for people to introduce themselves, after that left everyone wanting for a result that they already knew for another 4 hours, the whole first day was from 9 am until 5 pm just waiting for Theresa organizing herself.Some candidates decided to show up later in the day around 3:45 pm and they were received and accutually got a chance to had a small interview, what made Theresa and her colligue Emma thinks that they deserved more time than enyonelse that arrived there but 9 am??????? The next day we were asked to be there at 9 am again, and Theresa and her partner Emma had swapped about 5 CVs and lost some CVs as well that they could not find all day!!!!! I was all day wondering what makes Theresa thinks that she is better than anyone else in that room?? She thinks she is great, but she is fairway from being nice, she was snobby and arrogant I think tired as well, but she didn't not handle the situation and did not delivered any kind of customer service for all of us. After we all waited for two long days they had decided to check up if all candidates was tall enough and I understand that,but it should have been done at the beginning of the precess and not after two days of waiting around, people failed for that and for having tatoos as well. Another thing that I felt extremely sorry was for those who had to do the English test at 5pm in the Saturday after being stressed all day and been up since from 5 am in the morning, they were sitting in a room with around 50 people talking while they were doing their exam, it was a shame and a completely disrespect!!!! Half of us left there without knowing what day we are going to be interviewed.I am so disappointed, frustrated and disgusted with all of this and I don't want work or fly with Emirates after that, because if I am going to be treated like Theresa treated us, I rather stay where I am. There was people travelling from many different places to be there and also people who had to miss two days of work to be there as well and we all wish to be treated with a bit of more respect."
950,"The plane was declared not fit for use halfway through the flight, the stewardess panicked on the flight.  We were stuck in Bangkok in a near riot situation - managed to call the call center to get booked on a flight that would enable me to make my connection.  The booking team then canceled my seat on the connecting flight ""by mistake"" and proposed a flight home the following day via Croatia. After much stress then managed to get me on a flight to Heathrow then lost my luggage.  If I thought that that was bad, all pales into insignificance when dealing with the customer service.  Requested compensation and call costs to be covered.  Got offered nothing other than the possibility of my calls to Emirates being covered.  Would not even cover the personal call that I had to make to inform the UK I might be a day late etc.  The rudest team I have ever spoken with. Told me to call my lawyer."
951,"Booked event tickets through Skywards loyalty programme. Despite that we received a confirmation letter for the tickets and the miles have been deducted (immediately), we simply do not receive the tickets! Several emails remain unanswered! The call center refers to an email address, which is not answering! Totally unacceptable behaviour - close to fraud! Did not expect this from Emirates."
952,First class service as always all the way. Friendly helpful & great priced airline. Thank you all & recommend to all.
953,Asked to pay for seats. Bought a regular economy flex ticket and then came to know I have to purchase seats.Wow 5 star classy airlines when did you learn to pick customer pockets that way !! Policy is in place since Aug 2017.Trust me they say if you are flying on saver fare !! which is nothing less . you know Emirates fare!!
954,"I booked my flight online, never saw any information about getting charged extra for choosing my seat. I have a a connected flight both ways which totals of 4 planes and the seat choosing charges are up to £75 per trip. This is outrageous as you find this stuff on budget airlines not so called high standard airline. The customer services operator was rude and unhelpful, her tone changed as soon as she saw that I was not a Gold or Silver member. All of a sudden makes you feel rubbish. Will never use this airline again. No Stars"
955,"I flew with Emirates for the first - and probably - last time here in March and April. The trip was from Copenhagen to Taipei. I have been flying A LOT during the last 20 years, and Emirates still have a VERY LONG way to go to com near the service that Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, Air Canada, Cathay Pacific just to mention a few when it comes to service. The servings (food and drink) on the plane are slow (You have to wait for 2 hours after take off before getting ANYTHING!), the food is below standard, the staff looks like the basically don´t want to be on the plane - and there are no system in the way the do things. For instance my wife was told to remove the pillow from the floor at take off since it could be ""dangerous"", where at the same time I was allowed to have hard stuff like mobil phone, pc, etc. lying on the floor. Make no sense.On our way back from Taipei to Dubai after a 9,5 hour flight (we had a connecting flight to Copenhagen), we didn´t get into a real gate from the plane, but have to walk down the stairs as in the old days, and where the stuffed in buses which took us for a 30 min right (sightseeing??) in Dubai airport with the bus driving with a speed at around 20 mph. After we were dropped off - we had to take the skytrsin back to where we actually were supposed to be for our connecting flight to Copenhagen.When we finally arrived in Copenhagen, the staff ws to occupied smalltalking to eact other to make sure that people actually stayed seated during taxi ... half of the plane didn´t.All in all - the only positive experience during this flight was for me personally to fly with A 380 for the first time.I can not in any ways recommend to fly with Emirates!"
956,I really don't know where to begin from start to finish It started with hear say from travel agents saying there the best  econeny airline  in the world that's total rubbish Turkish air lines Thomas Cook and British airlines are much better by far and half the price .I have alot more to say plus video footage luckily I have a life  so I havnt got time now  I will talk about check in  and attach the video i filmed in a 4 hour queue tomorrow as well as them re selling your seat!
957,"What would you think if you book 4 flights on Thursday for you and your family, provide the correct Credit card details and click the buy button but the booking is not completed because the Emirates booking system has technical difficulties. This was confirmed by phone and email received with the incomplete booking and apologies. It was recommended by phone to try a few days later as the difficulties will be solved until Sunday the same week or can then call the service hotline again for assistance. When booking again on Saturday the same week the flights are € 1000 higher but Emirates is unwilling to give you the price from Thursday. Technically you do purchase a ticket when you click the buy button. So it is clearly the fault of Emirates and a very bad and unacceptable service.I am an Emirates Gold Member and would have expected a better service for anybody in this situation. But if even Gold status does not give you some sort of responsible service how bad will the general service  be for ordinary customers without an Emirates account?"
958,"Don't bother registering for air miles on Emirates, you won't be able to spend them! I had 30k acquired on two business flights to Sri Lanka.  just spent 2 hours on there site trying desperately to spend them without success, I couldn't even buy a tiny little speaker worth about £10 without spending another £45 on top, 3 times more than the value of the speaker. There website is also an utter joke, customer relations, even worse.. What an utter rip off. I will never use Emirates again, {Not if I'm paying for it}"
959,"Flight from Auckland to Dubai 18.10 EK 435 cancelled  4/3/18 due to burnt out circuit breaker .kept at gate for further 6 hours before they gave up trying to fix it, had to re enter New Zealand  get bags and wait for 90 mins to be allocated hotel as replacement  flight was 11.00pm the next day, 5 hours in hotel then had to leave back to airport, wait outside for two hours for check in to open,  wait around till flight and put in seats I didn't pre  book,  the seats I had paid £100 for where occupied  by some one else, the reason for booking seats was for a medical condition  but Emirates didn't  seem to care or be bothered, connecting flight Dubai to Manchester seated by the galley entrance absolutely  exhausted  every time nodded off hit by trolley by staff who had the service skills of children, tried to contact them for my flight delay certificate  but  they put every obstacle  in your way not to help you."
960,Very good. Easy booking and easy check in. Staff friendly and helpful. Flew Birmingham to Dubai with no issues. Overall great flying experience
961,"It's over a month since I flew back from Dubai on the 9.40am flight to Heathrow on 26th February and I'm still seething. Tried to contact Emirates but they don't have a simple email complaints procedure.So what annoyed me -  the senior steward (well that's how he appeared to act in relation to his fellow stewards) -  Brendon.Once airborne, whilst we passengers sate in our seats, he first paraded around with a carton of orange juice, pouring glass after glass until he had drained the carton. Then walked out of the galley with a packet of sandwiches and mucked those, before entertaining the stewardesses in an almost laddish, giggly fashion.Sorry Emirates - but I expected better, particularly after an absolute charming crew on our way out.The charade was totally unprofessional and would have been considered out of place even on a budget airline."
962,"EK 2 LHR-DXB 17th March.Emirates have cut down on little touches like hot towels and amenities pack. Which is a shame especially when you have to pay to choose seats.it was my daughter birthday on the flight and nothing special was done, even though I asked a steward she said they can take a picture and get some cake but then never turned up with anything, disappointed. In flight entertainment was excellent.EK29 DXB-LHR 21st MarchReturn flight was similar no amenity pack given, this time I want to point out the crew that were serving the right hand back of plane, the British stewards had arrogance and no service skills that were genuine! I prefer foreign staff who are genuinely happy to serve and make clients happy."
963,Not possible to change reservation in any way. Just nuy a new ticket!  No information about that before ordering directly from Emirates website :-(
964,"We use Emirates every other year when visiting our daughter in Perth Australia, our last trip we returned this February, Travelling long haul can be quite difficult but the emirates cabin crew always make you feel comfortable and nothing is too much for them, we have always received an outstanding service."
965,Bought two business class tickets to Dubai and back. On return journey it was the flight was bad with crew basically congregating in the back with no incentive to ask customers if they would like any drinks. Might as well bring our own food and drinks. Contacted Customer Service but no joy.
966,"Dear Emirates customer service manager, I'm writing this review because of Emirates made me impact on financial abilities. Emirates will not take any claim on flight cancellation and very bad customer services to rearrange flights and it inaccurred loss. Please careful while booking travel with Emirates airline and very bad serviceRegards S Attiyappagounder"
967,Recently flew Emirates from Brisbane to Dubai.Hopelessly late 2-3 hrs no explanation then as usual Dubai was choked with morning fog and 32 other planes circling waiting to land.Went in circles for 2 hrs so 5 hrs late for connecting flight to Ethiopia  which was held up.My luggage to Ethiopia didnt come for another day but because it didnt suit them they didnt send my bicycle for another day .I went on my bike trip without my bike only 150 $ US compensation offered.
968,Terrible service.... booked 2 tickets to Australia with agent then told we could not sit together. 24hr flight is hard enough without having to worry about my dad sitting elsewhere. Nobody tried to help change seats around was asked repeatedly if i was a frequent flyer with them so it begs the question 'so there was somethimg you could do if i was a ff'Disappointing
969,"I could not book a seat for our one year old, eventually I managed to get some one to tell me to change his age to over 2, then edit it after the tickets had been paid for.In the confusion, I booked the return flight for a month after we should return.Hours (not days) later I phoned them, and they charged us £250 to change it. This is months before the outward flight!We were assured that there would be push chairs at Dubai. There weren't, so we ended up carrying the baby for a very long time.Waited in one security queue for 40 minutes, then were told to wait in another one, also for a long time.No seats to sit on in Dubai, all full, floors dirty and long queues for the toilets. My wife went to change the baby, waited in the queue, then came back and said she would not change him there, as the toilets were filthy.On the way back, they lost the pushchair.Although we phoned the next day, they would do nothing, as they say we should have reported it at the airport, but there was nobody around at the time, and both the wife and baby had stomach cramps, so we really just wanted to get home, so didn't go in search of anyone.Would never use them again."
970,"ON my 8.35 AM flight March 3 from Dubai to Zurich sound was not working. What a horrible experience. Not only mine 44C, but also 44 A and B. Flight attendant said he will bring another ear piece, one hour later he said he FORGOT !!!!  Told him it's the jack that not working, not ear piece. One hour later, he brought anyway another ear piece, then pone more. Smarter supervisor listen and said that it's unfortunately, the jack is not working. Offered to give another place to sit, but they forgot . 7 hours of boring long flight."
971,Emirated started cancelling my flight from Kathmandu several months before I was even supposed to fly. Was on the phone with customer service for hours... and then they cancelled twice more! I feel this airline is not reliable at all and they offer virtually no support. I am flying a day later now and no financial compensation whatsoever. Would not recommend.
972,Their online booking system resulted in a very expensive mistake.
973,"What has started out as a good Journey out for my wedding and honeymoon is proving to end on a very sour note and in very poor taste with Emirates. Our journey was booked by a travel agent in the UK, namely Netflights, who bungled this and booked us on their normal economy on the way over which offers a generous 30kg baggage allowance but then booked the most basic of economy on the way back which only offers 20Kgs on the way back. As I say, we are here for a special occasion, travelling with the knowledge that we will need to bring back more than what we came over to Cape Town with and at no point would I have booked this knowing this.Now Emirates want to charge me R725.00 ZAR PER KILO for additional luggage and are categorically saying no to paying for an upgrade or the difference to their normal economy class. I find this ridiculous, short minded and we are very disappointed in their unwavering approach to our situation. I have been told I either pay R725.00 ZAR per kilo or buy a new ticket for me and Kate. What makes matters worse is Netflights are pointing the finger at me and emirates saying you need to take this up with Emirates and Emirates are point the finger back at me and Netflights saying as this booking was done by an agency, there is nothing they can do. All in all, this has been a very bad experience and end to our journey and one I hope customers pay close attention to. Emirates are very inflexible and impersonal and will not help you in situations where a third party agency is involved and Netflights focus only on sales at all costs including making booking that don't match your needs. Their approach is flawed and opportunitic while knowingly and misleadingly booking a return flight for a customer of a journey with significantly less benefits than the outbound journey where mixing classes under an economy flight will result in problems for their customers.All in all, think hard about which airline and travel provider you choose when travelling - stick with what you know, don't risk this kind of mess."
974,"Shocking aftercare service after 2 flights Dubai to Glasgow cancelled due to weather. We are meant to be staying in the company’s home country, the hotel we have been put up in is awful. Can’t tell us when we’ll be flying home, just to call every hour. Every passenger has had conflicting stories for the last 12 hours, seems you have to be business or first class to get some answer. This was the last stop on our honeymoon and the whole trip has been ruined because of this"
975,I had a very bad experience on the check-in counter at Bangaluru Airport in India never been treated like that so never ever travelling to Bangluru by Emirates I always travel by direct flight to India. But I had very good experience travelling to Dubai so I thought I will go by Emirates but never again.
976,"I have travelled with emirates nearly 20 times since last 15 years, alas they have just lost a customer! I was checking on line for flight to Cape town , to my surprise they have started charging minimum £20 to select a seat, I understand tihs scenario whth budget airline like ryan air, by doing this Emirates have downgarded its position from premuim airline to a rogue cheap airline"
977,"Booked flights via skyscanner at the cheapest rate for one senior and one minor to go to Australia rom the UK and then back via Hong Kong. Booking, paying and getting the tickets was simple and easy through the agent Carlton Leisure. The senior recently got diagnosed with Nerve issues in their neck which has gradually got worse over the passed couple of months (since booking!) The senior decided that they couldn't do the extra few days trip to Hong Kong on the way back so decided to change the flights to come straight back. The airline was fine with this and said we had given sufficient notice, Carlton Leisure charged us £75 booking fee per person and Emirate airlines charged £300 per person!!!! Emirates said on the phone that it was nothing to do with them, even thought they were the ones charging £300 cancellation fees- I got told Carlton leisure deal with a certain call centre within Emirates and I need to discuss with them, this number couldn't be gained via Carlton Leisure or via Emirates!Carlton Leisure refused to speak to the airline on my behalf and as I couldn't speak to the same team they got in touch with, there is a senior and a minor that are £375 out of pocket each because this fee couldn't be waivered, even though the tickets will be sold again, they are not out of pocket and we haven't used any of their time as we did it via a different website and not customer facing- We booked 4 months in advance and cancelled with 3 months remaining and they still couldn't reduce the cancellation fee's even a little!!!Absolutely fuming- They have no shame at all- 2 months notice of cancellation and an ill senior and they still couldn't negotiate to even reduce the cancellation fee's!!!!Booking and taking your money is easy- The credit is now going to take as long as 5-6 weeks to be returned to the customer!!! Was on hold for hours which each number trying to get through to people from different offices to sort out this issue.. No partial cancellation so we couldn't just change the return flights!!Poor customer service, phone lines are always going down half way through conversations and no one rings you back even when you've been cut off!"
978,"Flew with them to Mauritius earlier in the year through Dubai, amazing flight and as a treat we upgraded to Business class for the Manchester to Dubai leg of the trip, most outstanding flying experience I have ever had, flying again to Dubai in a few weeks and can't wait for the flight never mind the holiday which is also booked through Emirates Holidays and was also seamless.Keep up the amazing work."
979,Great airline! Always try and fly with them as much as possible.
980,"flown emirates by choice on several occasions, when booking a package deal I always upgrade to Emirates flights. Service is fantastic and they are fantastic with Children. my son is a huge Emirates fan also."
981,"We weren't seated together despite my calling them in advance tocheck we would be and were lied to that we would! We would have had to pay for seat allocation for an aisle seat, I suffer from severe motion sickness and was sick constantly customer service didn't care when.I told them of the outward ordeal. If I didn't pay they weren't going to allocate an aisle seat. They are after your $$$$ only and they don't even pretend to, or pay lipservice to caring about their customers, and those inconvenienced around me unable to reach toilet in time & I was not advised of extra charges to secure seats at point of booking. Additionally food really abysmal, and despite 2 flights totally 15 hours to our destination we weren't given an eye mask, ear plugs, toothbrush NADA.. Basically a budget airline charging NON BUDGET prices, do NOT be fooled by their ads, they are the worst long haul airline in the skies. I'll fly anything  but Emirates in the future. Shocking uncaring budget airline without the cheap prices!!!"
982,I'm a regular traveller. If possible will always fly Emirates. Competitive pricing. Quality lounges. An excellent customer service culture - every time. Thank you.
983,"We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved.  After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. Flight Centre then called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. The Emirates staff member on the phone was helpful and said not to worry as there was a flight out of Dubai to Bangkok at 11.45 so if we were delayed then we could get onto that flight, she also said that staff on the flight would have contact with the ground and would be able to update us once we got on the flight if we would make up time in the air. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. On the flight no one could tell us anything about our connecting flight, there seemed to be lots of passengers concerned and if anything we found the staff unhelpful and some even quite rude. We were extremely worried as this was our honeymoon. We had planned on spending a night in Bangkok then the following day fly to Siam Reap Cambodia. We had a hotel booked and dinner reservations on the evening of 21st December. Due to the delay, we had to run off our flight once we had landed in Dubai, there were Emirates staff with signs to connecting flights but no signs for our Bangkok one. We asked someone and they did not have a clue. We then ran to try and find a sign, got through security and found our gate just before 09.30. The plane was there at the gate but Emirates staff told us boarding had ended and we were unable to board our plane. They told us we had to go to the desk, which of course we did not know where this was and we were given no help or instruction from this staff member as to where this desk was. It was a cleaner who barely spoke English that eventually told us where we needed to go. We arrived at the desk where there was a queue of people in the same situation. We spoke to another Emirates staff member and told her our situation and she said she could get us on the 03.00 flight the following day to Bangkok. This of course was not feasible as we had a hotel booked in Bangkok then a flight out of here to Siam Reap at 07.30, so this would make us miss the flight. We asked about the 11.45 as this is what the Emirates staff member had told our travel agent. Apparently this flight was now full, which we didn’t understand as we had already informed Emirates that we were likely to miss our flight. Emirates already knew we would be missing our flight, our travel agent had rang ahead so we do not understand why we weren’t already booked on to this flight. After half an hour the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. At this point, we still had no apology what so ever and at no point did anyone reassure us. We boarded the flight to Mumbai, however this flight did not land into Mumbai on time, by this point we were extremely anxious about the delay as we didn’t want to miss another flight. On arriving in Mumbai there was an airport worker who fast tracked us through the connecting flight process. We waited at the gate, there was another delay and we had not even boarded the plane when it was scheduled to take off. This made us worry even more that we would not land on time for our Siam Reap flight. We were meant to land two and a half hours before however we landed just under two hours. We were stood in the very long Bangkok immigration queue thinking we had missed our Siam Reap flight at this point as there was no way we would get through, get our luggage, find the new check in, check in, go through security and board. However, we did make this flight by running through the airport and the flight desk still being open to check in luggage. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester. It was not the perfect start to our honeymoon, we spent time hanging around airports or on planes."
984,"We had a terrible experience with Emirates and were very disappointed since they advertise themselves as the #1 voted airline. We flew from NYC to DBX to Colombo, Sri Lanka.  They lost our baggage.  We were told it would be delivered to our hotel the next day and that it would arrive on a 5 am flight.   We ended up receiving our bags 30 hours later after multiple calls to Emirates and the airport!On our way home,  we flew from Male to DBX to JFK.  There was bad weather in NYC.  3 hours before our flight,  we got a text that our DBX to JFK flight had been cancelled.   At the airport,  none of the Emirates representatives assisted us and told us we need to contact Emirates customer service.   After calling multiple numbers,  we finally got through to someone in Boston.   She didn't understand why the Emirates employees did not help us.   Ultimately,  we got to Dubai.  Our 5 hour layover became a 5 day layover!Emirates had availability on flights earlier,  but because they were business class seats,  they wouldn't bump anyone. It just goes to show you that Emirates cares more about money than it does about their guests.  They provided no reimbursement for anything.  It cost us an extra $1000 to stay in a hotel.  Imagine if we couldn't afford that. Don't fly with Emirates if possible."
985,Very Good Service. Very happy. Price is bit expensive on their own website compare to agent's website
986,"Worst experience with Emirates, stuff is rude and unfriendly. My flight from Dubai to Bangkok was delayed due to traffic, we sat on the plan for approximately 2 hours. Hot as hell, not offering anything to drink. Why take soo long to serve us food and drinks? And when you finally do that you make it seem like you’re serving orphans."
987,"I recently traveled to India with Emirates from US. That happened to me my bad experience. firstly emirates doesnt allow to check in when there is a flight with other flights.I was allocated a seat next to restroom and next to a kid crying whole night. in the 16hr flight no sleep. flights attendance didnt show some courtesy of chaning my seat. every now and then some one or the other disturbs me since seat was arranged in such a pathetic position. I cannot play movies due to disturbance, infact not even able to give feedback in the flight.Flight attendants not very helpful. I have to ask for water atleat 3 times to get one. They are not at all helpful. I use to choose Emirates as my first choice, but for the money paid, my dissatisfaction with Emirates is so high that I do not recommend Emirates to any one.On top of this my luggage was broken to check causing further key loss and bag damage. A brand new bag when reached US and India it looked as if I have been using that bag for years. so much mishandling/pathetic handling of baggage.Lets see if emirates really reach out to me after this rating if they really care about the customers"
988,"I booked a couple of business class tickets from Buenos Aires to Rio De Janerio. The total amount I paid was approx £1780. I had made the booking from London. I cancelled the reservation (both tickets) on the 17th November. After 50 days, I am still battling with Emirates to refund the amount for one of the tickets. The money for the first ticket was only refunded after 40 days. Not only that, due to the long time they have taken to refund the money, the exchange rate has moved against me casing me a loss of £140 already. I am still waiting for a refund of the second ticket and I don't seem to be getting anywhere with it.  Appalling customer service, the calls are being routed to a call center in Budapest and they don't seem to have any control over the refund process. There is no one else I can speak to. The whole process is just frustrating."
989,They charged me for the same ticket twice. I submitted a refund request more than one month ago with no response and they dont reply to emails. Worst Customer service. They simply don't care.
990,Having read some of the recent reviews I can only sympathise as it appears to be a common practice by emirates to bump passengers of flights presumably having oversold seats or selling to maximise a premium flight cost for standby passengers Our emirates flight from Birmingham on 27th December had been delayed but we were in time for connecting flight from Dubai to Sydney In a technology world it was very evident that the strategy was to hack off the 20+ passengers by stating the luggage was not going to be available in time and we had to travel with itAlso the flight did not depart at 09.35 but at 11.00am so it was a very lame excuse used and therefore having to transfer to the flight next dayIn the interim and for 24hours emirates transferred passengers to their hotel that could only be rated as 2 starOne towel was provided for an overnight stay and the food left a lot to be desiredWe could go on forever regarding this experience with emirates but it is time for their management to get out of their ivory tower and try this kind of experience for themselves Perhaps then they may appreciate the value of good customer care and what it does to enhance their brand
991,"we where on a flight from BKK to AMM on Dec 21 with a layover in DXB (Flights: EK419, EK901) but we missed our second flight EK901 because of a delay of landing on the flight EK419 for about 15 minutes, then we faced another delay in the bus who is carrying passengers from the airplane to arrivals gate, it take about 50 minutes from the moment the airplane's doors opened to the moment we get out of the bus, with additional security check time and walking time to reach the next gate.the result is that we missed our next flight to Amman.we went to flight connection office in DXB airport and they said that the reason of missing the flight is us, we tried to describe the issue to them but they refused to believe us.the way they fixed the problem was potting us on the waiting list of the next flight EK903 departing at 14:05 Dec 21, and charge us USD 45 for each passenger.there was another 8 passengers who were facing the same issue ( those was only the passengers who i sow and talk to them)so we lost 45$ and faced another 6 hours waiting in the airport.it was emirates and DXB airport fault but no one believed us.i heard allot of the emirates but when i tried it, i found it one of the worst airlines ever,its the last time me and my friends and family flying with emirates. and this will be the recommendation i will give for any one asking about emirates, i'll but it in any website rating airlines, or any travel website."

993,"My mother and I were traveling from India, (Mumbai) to Dubai in a connecting flight to Johannesburg, final destination being Botswana, (Francistown). I was diagnosed with typhoid approximately 5-6 days before my flight, I had received the necessary medication and was cleared by the doctor to fly.  Unfortunately, during the flight from India to Dubai, I started to feel unwell and vomited on the plane, this was towards the end of the journey and the plane was in its landing stage. Because of the vomiting and pre-existing condition, I become very weak and was not able to breathe properly, sweating and shaking. My mum then requested one of the air hostesses for a wheel chair as I was not able to walk and she was afraid that I would probably faint because of my condition. The air hostess told my mother that because we had not previously requested for a wheelchair that it was not possible for them to arrange one in such short notice. My mother repeatedly requested for a wheelchair but the air hostess said that her and their supervisor cannot make any such arrangements. I had to walk all the way down the stairs and take the bus in that condition, while my mother carried not just her luggage, but mine as well. She was carrying about 4 bags and not one staff member assisted her. Even on the ground, after walking down the stairs and taking the bus to reach the terminal there was no help/aid or assistance waiting to assist me or my mother. As soon as we got off the bus my mother made me sit down on the chair went to the nearest group of staff members who had wheel chairs and asked them for medical assistance, they told us to walk to the nearest medical team and my mother showed them me, I was lying down on the chair, crying, unable to breathe and my eyes were just rolling up. My mother showed them that I was unable to even sit up, so walking to the medical team was out of the question. After that, one guy from the staff members went to call the medical team, it had been at least 7-10 minutes and no one had come, not the staff member or any medical assistance! At this point my mum was panicking and hyperventilating looking at my condition, asking the other staff members where the medical assistance was and no one was answering or assisting her. She had to leave me and go check up on that guy who went to call the medical team, AND THEN ONLY, did the medical team come and I was then taken to the medical centre where I was put on drips. The helpful doctors had then cleared me and said I was able to catch my flight to Johannesburg, the doctors had contacted services for a wheelchair, and they took an hour just to bring a wheel chair in, very well knowing that we were already getting delayed for our flight. I may have expected such poor service and bad behaviour from other airlines, but I never expected this from Emirates because we are frequent flyers and always prefer to fly through Emirates, because of the good service and understanding in situations. This was absolutely unacceptable."
994,"My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting at sunday 10th of december in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived tuesday morining at 5 a.m. in Hyderabad/india. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14h hours.It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in frankfurt. Well things like this happen and this is nothing to worry about, but sitting more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, emirates wasn´t able to serve even a glass of water to the guests. First miss.The flight itself to dubai was Ok. In order to get the connected flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running down the airport of dubai and finally reached the gate right in time. Everything went fine, we even manage to be at the gate more than 30min before gate-closing - that was my thought... And here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us, that our seat have been already given away without any further explaination. They obviously know that passengers from another emirates fligth arriving, but they decide to took away the seats. This is something I can´t understand and it is not acceptable for me. I also know from another colleague sitting in the plane that the flight even got free seats (in business as well as in economy). Second BIG miss! The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 a.m. in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, got kicked out the plane - there was a long lane of passengers at the counter (remember: it was 3 a.m. in the morning - not rush hour). We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a lane, standing on our feet without seeing any emirates-employee offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we manage to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening, knowing that we will miss our first meetings in india. But thats not the end of the story. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to dubai (another 30min of waiting at the immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 a.m. in the moring reaching a frustrating, third-class emirates-hotel. We got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 a.m. in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep having a noisy construction area next to the hotel... Summary: At a long distance journey things can turn worse due to delays and this is quiete normal. But: I can´t understand why they act like this. I had not the feeling emirate really take care about us and it was obviously emirates fault to took away our booked seats for the connecting flight. There was no apologize and the inconvenience was tremendously high even from an airline claiming for itself to be the best airline in the world. This was my first experience with emirates and at the moment I am NOT looking forward for the flight back to germany."
995,"I've travelled on Emirates A380 plane business class 4 times now and cannot speak highly enough of them. From the moment the executive car picks you up from home to smooth check in process, business class lounge and then onto a private lane that takes you to your seat. Everything was seemless and thing just got better while in the air...from the stand up bar to 15in tv with flat beds....worth every penny."
996,"Definitely the best economy class flight I have had so far. Food, entertainment system, space: everything is a class higher than in most of competitors. But the seat was way too firm for such a long flight. Aside that everything perfect!"
997,"My experience with emirates.com customer service has been awful. I bought a return ticket from Gatwick to Yangon. After less than 12h I realised that i bought the wrong ticket (I am not perfect, I am a human being) and I contacted to the emirates support team from the chat twice to explain my problem.The only explanation they gave to me is that I had to pay an extra £142 fee. Really? after paying a return ticket that cost me £700? They knew that it was a mistake, I bought the wrong ticket and the time past was less than 12h. I asked them if I could have another option, but the only thing they did was to close the chat, even telling them I did not wanted to close the chat, they just did it. What kind of customer service is this?I also tweeted them and write a PM on twitter on both accounts: @EmiratesSupport and  @emirates and after some hours, the replied to me just saying ""really sorry"" and ""please, let us know your email address"" I am still waiting for a response, after hours and hours, no response. I tried to call them but the line was always busy.What kind of service is this? how is it possible that a company like Emirates treats its returning customers like this? this is unbelievable."
998,"emirates-shame.comI have been flying with Emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service, and did not sell exit row seats. No longer it seems…I recently booked a flight with Emirates to Indonesia, only to find after paying for the flight that Emirates now charge for exit row seats, in this case an additional £150!I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a £100 cancellation fee or email customer services. I emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a £100 cancellation fee.Shame Emirates. Shame.Emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price. Even easyJet and Ryanair show users the full price of their tickets before purchase!Emirates used to be a company that put customers at the heart of the business. I guess now it is just money.emirates-shame.comI have mapped Emirates current booking process highlighting the dishonest experience Emirates are using to sell tickets to customers. In addition I have mapped an improved process that is honest and transparent, which I suggest Emirates implement.Considering the work I have done to improve Emirates booking process, perhaps Emirates can pay me the £100 charged for cancelling the flight?"
999,"I recently travelled with Emirates together with my boyfriend as we went to Phuket. I had high expectations since I have heard that Emirates should be very good. Though I must say I was very disappointed. The customer service was terrible. I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves. One time a stewardess was serving drinks and as she presented the tablet with the drinks, my boyfriend wanted to take the tray to make it easier to take our drinks. Then she said in not such a friendly tone; ""Just take the drinks please."" Not politeness, no smile. I don't know if they are able to smile, because we didn't see much of it. They may think that the red lipstick makes them look nice, but a smile is way more beautiful. Another time a stewardess was serving food and drinks and as she came to our row I looked up. Then she said in an arrogant tone; ""Hold on please"", then walked away and came back a little later. I hadn't said anything to her. At the end of a flight a man came to collect all the headphones. I gave mine to my boyfriend so he could give it, because he sat by the aisle. He gave it to the man and a little later the man asked for the headphones, not in a nice way and with no smile. My boyfriend then told him he had already given it. He just looked and then went on. No apology, which one would actually expect. When you work in the service business you cannot act all arrogant and superior, because then you lose customers which you are dependent on to receive salary. They obviously didn't learn what I learned as I was working in the service business. That the customer is the boss. Because without customers, you cannot earn anything. I guess they don't understand that concept. They should either start acting professional and give proper customer service or find themselves a new job in a different field. Another thing was that as we boarded the plane, it reeked of perfume, which was just very nauseating to be honest. Very disappointing was also on the flight from Dubai to Phuket as my boyfriend and I didn't get to sit together even though we had booked as a couple. We were told that if there were some available seats in the back that we could maybe sit together. The stewardess never came. My boyfriend then saw that there were some available seats in the back and we asked a stewardess if we could sit there. Then she said that no, these seats are for the cabin crew to sit down for breaks. Uhm, what? I have never experienced that the cabin crew is sitting with the rest of the passengers. So this was very odd. The food was ok, the entertainment was not to be complained about, but the rude, unfriendly, arrogant cabin crew just ruined everything for me. I have this to say to those arrogant stewardesses; ""Get over yourselves and get down from your high horse, you are not better than anyone."" So I will not be travelling with Emirates again, and I will certainly not recommend it to anyone I know, quite the contrary actually."
1000,"Have recently done eight flights with Emirates and it's been a mixed bag.  Initial flights were HAM - DXB - Entebbe.  All flights were fine, had Asian Vegetarian Meals and found the whole experience pretty good.  Was impressed.Two months later and we just did HAM - DXB - Yangon.  Completely different experience.  Flight attendants in Economy couldn't give a monkeys.  So rude and arrogant it's unreal.  Takes them two hours to serve you a glass of water and beware if you dare to press your button to ask them for anything.  Nobody will come for an hour and then they'll huff that you've dared ask them for something.  On Ham - DXB, we must have had a new person serving drinks on our side because we'd been in the air for three hours and finished our food before we got any drinks and then the girl was unbelievably rude!  Asian Vegetarian meals were horrible which was surprising after they'd been so good before.  I can overlook all of that but what did annoy me was that on one flight, we left at 2am and it was a 6 hour flight to Dubai.  All I wanted to do was sleep.  I stuck my Do Not Disturb sticker to my seat, put my eye mask on and slept.  Three hours later some guy is frantically prodding me to give me a meal I didn't want!  I managed to sleep again and then got woken up by them collecting the blankets 90 minutes before landing.  After the initial drinks service, there is no more service from them, you have to go and ask for what you want and they won't smile when they give it to you.On the flip side, we upgraded to Business for one leg of the trip.  Totally different experience.  Friendly, attentive and smiley staff who couldn't trip over themselves enough to make sure we were looked after, although I still didn't think much of the food (standard Emirates business class meal this time.)  All in all, a bit of a mixed bag.  Economy seats are comfortable and the entertainment system is pretty good, although some of the 'New Films' in August were still there in November.  Lie-flat seats in Business are great.  We've had to call their helpline a couple of times and they've been friendly enough to deal with.  I would fly with them again, but I think Air New Zealand is better."
1001,Emailed full on complaint Ignores for 3 weeks Final get through to ceo team and told ten days now day 13 and still nothing Matthew is rude in that team and obnoxious and I can’t complain about him as he hangs up each time avoid like the plague
1002,"I started my return journey in Bali and was getting a connecting Emirates flight to London from Dubai. After going through both the Bali and Dubai security gates perfectly fine, I was surprised to be searched once again at the boarding gate in front of all the other passengers with no explanation whatsoever as to why this was happening. Even though no one else seemed to be being searched apart from me. When I asked the security officer why I was being searched, I was told it was a random security check however on my outward journey to Bali (also an emirates flight)  I was also singled out and questioned by an officer at the boarding gate. I have never flown with Emirates airline before and this experience has tarnished my first impression I was humiliated, made to feel like a criminal and turned into a spectacle by this experience and offered no real explanation as to why. After already being on a long flight from Bali to Dubai, this was the last thing I needed and ruined my mood for the rest of my journey home. Not only this but the staff were cold and unpleasant in comparison to staff on previous flights with airlines such as BA and Virgin and to make matters even worse the airline ran out of both my meal options so I was left hungry as well as upset. I definitely will not be flying with Emirates again."
1003,"This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last.We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite.The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service.The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stoney faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience.Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven’t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers?We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final “thank you for flying Emirates” sounded matter of fact and so insincere.On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers’ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers.Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore airlines again - far superior."
1004,"I have now flown with Emirates several times. Overall all my interactions so far has been good with Emirates. I've had to contact them a few times about bookings and Skywards membership. Very friendly service. Also pretty good inflight service usually and also very friendly ground staff.So I was genuinely surprised when I recently wanted to manage my booking to make my seat selection and encountered a small issue which has since resulted in a very poor customer experience.I'm about to fly from Sydney to Europe and noticed Emirates was now charging for advance seat selection when I logged into my booking to select my seat preference. As this seems to be the trend now also for international flights I accepted it as part of life and purchased advance seat selection for my four upcoming flights to the value of $100.I then realised my Skywards membership had not been recorded as part of my booking, so I edited my booking again after having purchased my advance seat selection. After providing my membership number I noticed that now my seat selection was complimentary due the status of my membership.So I contacted Emirates and explained the situation and what had happened and that I could see I was entitled to free advance seat selection, but had in fact paid $100. Would they be kind enough to process a refund for the $100?The initial customer service representative was very friendly and helpful. She would look into it and come back to me directly. Sure enough I received a call back the same afternoon after she had checked with the web team. Unfortunately the web team had declined to refund the $100 as apparently there are prompts somewhere during the advance seat selection purchase process. I clearly missed these prompts, so I question the UX design in this process and explained this to the representative.The representative explained there was nothing more she could do, but she empathised with my situation and suggested my only other option was to lodge a complaint. I was genuinely surprised not to say dumbfounded by this outcome.I'm not one for lodging complaints let alone jumping on social media or Trust Pilot. However this just seems too silly!I find it incredible that a company like Emirates flat out refuses to process a refund for the small amount of $100 for something their customer in this situation is clearly entitled to. Furthermore that I have to go to the length of lodging a complaint instead of simply having the issue resolved by customer service. In my mind it seems like such an easy and clear cut refund situation that any customer service representative should be able to accept and process?!For me this translates to extremely poor customer service which is probably partly grounded in internal processes and bureaucracy that doesn't make it straight forward to process the refund. In the end the customer suffers. So my otherwise good experience is now not so good and I will most likely go back to Singapore Airlines again in the future. All for $100 that I was entitled to as a customer. Incredible."
1005,"Flew back from Dubai to Heathrow on 12.10 on 7th November and this was without the best flight I have flown on. The food was great and entertainment excellent. A big thanks to Ben who looked after us throughout, will be back to dubai next year and definitely with Emirates."
1006,"Ruined the start of my honeymoon.Our flight to dubai was late by 30 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight to Mauritius. Had to wait in dubai airport for 7 hours and we were only given meal vouchers as compensation - no money off, no upgrades, not even an apology. We've lost around £300 on our holiday, money which I'm currently trying to claim back but will not be holding my breath for. I will never be flying with Emirates again, their customer service is non existent and they treat people completely different to the likes or British Airways. No class at all."
1007,Emirates is an amazing airline! Always fly emirates when I go Middle East or further. Stop off in Dubai is always good! Brilliant airport. The service from start to finish with emirates is always good! Extremely child friendly airline! They look after you and make sure you have everything! Will always try and fly emirates!!
1008,"The best in-flight-entertainment and good quality food on board. Very helpful cabin crew, majority of the flights on time. Good connections in Dubai airport. The customer service on the phone could be better and more professional."
1009,No one in customer service knows what they are doing and fob you off with prepared email letters. World's greatest airline my backside.
1010,"Hi, first off excuse my english I'm not a native. I'm a gold member emirates, and just want to share my experience, I do fly business/ or first with the company, I'll pass on the service which was really good in business at first but not anymore, and the outdated cabins if you compare to lot of airlines now.First still ok, if you see yourself as Cendrillon.But the mainly issue is when you try to book a ticket with miles, for example today I was trying to purchase a flight from BKK to HK 2 ways, skywards price was 40 000 miles,  i had 39 300 miles so I had to purchase 2000 miles more, then as soon as they updated my balance, the same flight was 47 500 miles, I understand that prices may varie, but normally 47 500 miles is for flex fare, but Saver fare in currency still available.It is not the first time that this happen to me, and it looks (to me) that the settings/cookies of their website aren't really honest.I called their callcenter, and the lady keep telling me that there is no Saver fare available for this flight, and that was the reason for the increase of prices/miles, Even I had in front of me the Saver fare available online which I purchased when I ended the call. Another story, I changed a booking while i was in China for an HK flight with my wife, emirates charged me the amount on my credit card, I got a confirmation. all was fine.The next day after travelling all day, we arrived at HK airport, check-in, where the ground staff asked me to pay again because they didn't get my payment, so I had to pay 2 times, but the worst in this is that they kept us 2 hours standing at their desk, after a 8 hours trip to get another 3 hours flight. So we didn't have the time to rest at the lounge, then the business Class with LCD that doesn't work and not seats available to change, and other issues that i don't recall, but stuff that you would like to enjoy as you just paid that much for your flight.I sent email to customer.affairs @ emirates.com and never got any replies.I called their center in Dubai, and had someone even not telling me that they was sorry, but "" it is our system sir, sometimes it happens"" WDFWell Emirates, sometimes you are loosing customer""all that said, just don't go for their Boolshit membership, for a little reward at the end, you got better companies than this and treat you way better than this.They do not deserve your money."
1011,"In January 2017 I booked two economy flights on line from London to Cape Town for my wife and I and we hoped to travel in November 2017. Sadly, I was diagnosed with cancer recently, and it was recommended that I start chemotherapy treatment immediately. This meant that it was not recommended that I travel. I communicated with Emirates on 3 occasions - two on the phone and once on twitter. They have refused to waive their cancellation fee of £200 per ticket. I think they are heartless and have no human compassion. I have had to cancel accommodation, car rental, car parking and other flights - and on every occasion all have offered full refunds without any cancellation fee.I've written to the owner of the airline and its CEO and not had a response to date. I eventually received a refund after several months."
1012,"Emirates flight Economy Very good service with delicious food and access to latest movies, listening to latest music I watched movies such as Baywatch. On the way going I watched Baywatch and on the way back I watched Diary of a Wimpy kid full movie In HD with access to free headphones and good seating and space. The food was great with good service and the air hostesses were really nice and they provided us with good food whenever we wanted it and had access to a wide range of drinks whenever you feel like it. Overall it was a wonderful flight with great service and access to a wide range of meals and choices."
1013,Flew with Emirates to South Africa (via Dubai) and service was excellent. I'm 6'3'' and leg room was pretty good. In flight entertainment was excellent. And staff really polite at the desks and on the flight.
1014,"The continuing story from the ""Impolite and bad service""I waited for a report back from the customer support department of the Emirates head office but after a few days I didnt recieve any reply.I thought that it might be the problem with mail itself so I went to Facebook and explain the problem but again, the communication slowly started to face. The Emirates Airline seems to have the issue of ignoring questions and opinions from costumers and passengers. By the way, we can't directly talk to the customer support department from the website, FAX, email but only on phone but the phone is only a voice announcement, therefore, we as a costumers won't have a proper coversation with them. In additional, there was a news annouced in July 2017 about Emirates Airlines flight attendane pouring champagne leftover by the customer into the bottle. Emirates Airline says that they will have an investigate the issue. However, after the announcement (the end of September 2017) no results or comment came from the Emirates Airline by searching.If you use Emirates Airlines, please use travel insurance with great guarantee, that won't be a troublesome. Also, if you have any requests and opinions for the company's service then there will be no customer support department because they will completely ignore your comments except for Facebook."
1015,"vegetarian food should be easy to do, give me a salad and simple pasta dish and I'll be happy. The options online were Asian vegetarian, vegan or raw vegetables- surely there sure be a simple vegetarian/lacto ovo option which other airlines seem to be on board with. I ordered the Asian vegetarian- I was unbelievably disappointed with the quality of food. What I got was two meals (lunch and dinner) which were exactly the same because they couldn't be bothered to bring two different meals onto the plane. The food did not taste of anything and the dessert was foul- surely they have people tasting the food before serving it to the mass public?! We also had air hostesses talking to each other over our heads waking me up whilst I was asleep and also arguing with each other later on regarding the meals. It was quite frankly embarrassing and so unprofessional - I will not be flying with them again"
1016,"Flew to Dubai a couple of times with them, all went smoothly.  They have the most attractive stewardesses for sure."
1017,"Non existent customer service. They ignore emails and tell you over the phone that they will respond in 30 days (yep, a whole month!). I have completely given up now, it has been 6 months. I would say in flight service is fine but once you are off the plane, there is zero interest in resolving issues (like lost luggage which is pretty basic in their industry). I now stick to Turkish Airlines, they have been wonderful."
1018,"We flew from Birmingham to Thailand stopping at Dubai both ways for 2 and 1 night , Hong Kong 3 nights and Thailand 2 weeks . I had to pay for medical form and a letter from drs to get assisted help on and off plane which cost me about £50 , the airlines assured me they would help as I was travelling with someone unwell , this wasn't done on 4 out of 5 flights We had a baby and cases left on floor next to us during whole landing procedure , photos as evidence They booked me a vegan meal for 5 flights I had ordered normal for me vegetarian for daughter We had a lady next to us with a baby with a dirty nappy that stunk for 3 hours and cabin crew wouldn't talk to her just kept coming and spraying around us ,she took over all my leg room and the chap on other side to her , he was complaining, but we were both told no other seats to move too , her child was restless all flight kept kicking me, pulling my dress, standing on my feet and she didn't seem to speak English , so that didn't help situation, worst flight Ive ever been on We had a gang of thieves on Dubai to Hong Kong flight and police came on board which caused my daughter to get really upset she had mild mental health issues , a long wait checking everyone out for stealing , no help was given after police left , despite asking for assistance I had booked and paid for No one from the booking flights to departing from Bangkok to Dubai told us they were keeping our cases , we arrived in Dubai not knowing they had put our cases in hold we had nothing, no clothes , toiletries , some tabs were in case , hair brushes etc, it took them 3 1/2 hours to get our cases back , which made us miss our meal at hotel I got very sick about 10 hours after eating chicken on plane and ended up in hospital for a day and had to come home 3 days later than our booked flight , I had eaten nothing else , I suspect it was on plane as we arrived 11.30 pm and had missed half board meal so we went to sleep and Woke up early hours being very sickThey are being very unhelpful , all they are saying is we are sorry you have had to complain about flights , completely ignored all things I've asked about I'm in process of contacting CAA for help , not only were these flights terrible and I haven't mentioned everything but the handling has been dreadful , would not recommend emirates . We went on 3 internal Thai £20/£50 cheap flights all on time and no prbs , not impressed 1 bit with emirates , their last reply said we are not commenting further , I've had no answers to anything I asked , or why no assistance that was all arranged , disgusting behaviour , anyone with disabilities beware if flying with emiratesthe customer care team dont give a dam once they have your money,  dont reply to questions, lie and make up excuses, dont expect any help once you have flewn and have problems, ignorant customer service team, you should be ashamed of yourselves"
1019,GREAT EXPERIENCE....GREAT SERVICE AND SUPPORTING STAFF...GREAT FOOD...GREAT PRICE...LOOKING LIKE A LOVELY FLYING BIRD..........THANKS YOUR GREAT SERVICE...
1020,"Can't supply a gf meal for my child who is a coeliac who eats solids because they can't put it in their system, if asked if we could pay for an extra meal and was told no. Booked 5 months in advance and it was me following up about seat placement when we found out they had not confirmed mine or my daughters gf meal, When speaking to customer service was given different information about what we can and can't do in bringing our own food onboard and they blame everyone else but themselves. Can't believe they have such rude people in customer service."
1021,"My 5-year old son had a slight fever, and the guy who was in charge of the flight kicked us out of the flight and told us to disappear. This included my wife who was four months pregnant. She was made to stand up in a queue for over 3 hours so we can get a ticket for the next flight which was the following day. If you're a dark-skinned Asian you will get rubbish treatment by these people. Cause they're racist and think they're above you. When I asked the guy whats next, He said now you're kicked out of the plane, and It's up to you to find an another flight so get lost. When we got to the flight the following day, we were served bad meals. I got food poisoning and I was throwing up the entire flight back to Oslo. The staff doesn't give a damn, and if you look closely, you will see the staff is multicultural, and you know they have their preferences. Chinese looking staff is always assisting, and chit-chatting to Chinese looking passengers and ignore everyone else. So on and so. You get the idea. In my 34-year life Emirates is the most disgusting and racist airlines I ever flew. The ground staff are the worst. Horrible and uncivilised. Never again in my life, I will fly this airline."
1022,"I boarded the flight EK349 from Singapore to Srilanka. When I landed in srilanka, I found that both mine and my fathers  bag was broken into. I made an official complaint regarding this to the Sri Lankan Baggage services and have dealt with officers Miss Dilanthi Janashanka and Mr Ravi Valivita. Their customer service has been suboptimal and disappointing.Looking at the bags, My bag was a samsonite bag that cost me AUD 400. The zip on this bag was broken and ripped off from the bag so no longer able to close. The second picture shows the padlock that was on my fathers bag which was manipulated so can no longer fit key into it. As far as I am concerned, there are two issues. 1) Broken bag which the Sri lankan Emirates office is refusing to give me compensation 2) Issues with security When I buy tickets from Emirates, I expect my bags and goods to be looked after from the time I give the bags into the times I collect them. In this period, my bag was broken into. As far as I am concerned,anyone could have access to contents in my bag and FURTHER MORE, COULD HAVE EASILY PUT ANY DANGEROUS MATERIALS IN MY BAG. This is a criminal act which Miss Dilanthi Janashanka and Mr Ravi Valivita completely denied and told me that its likely that the bag was broken on the belt. I have been contacting MissDilanthi Janashanka ( 94112258933) via phone and emails on a daily basis regarding this and nothing has been done about this. They initially agreed to fix my bag but instead put two cheap ""hush puppies brand"" zips on it, which is unexpectable. I expected Emirates to replace the bag as it was or give me compensation for the amount I spent for the bag. They have completely refused to do this and I would like this looked intoI have not seen my parents in over a year and I have come to sri lanka to spend time with them. Instead of relaxing, I have been stressed with this situation and now with no luggage bag to take my belongings back with. I trusted Emirates with my bag and my goods and to be honest, I expected better customer service. The issue of the bag has not been resolved and the Security issue (with regards to investigate who is responsible for the bag being broken into) have not been dealt with and these are both very serious issues. I am very annoyed, disappointed and upset with this airline and would not be recommending this to anyone. The stress and the ordeal I have been through is unspeakable."
1023,My name is Mrs Amie Coleh Jammeh I have been an faithful Emirates customer for years now and I decided to go for Hajj this year. Hajj being what is on my way backI was sick and very tired every Muslim who comes back from that Holy voyage suffer from fatigue cough and sneez. I took Emirates from Jeddah to Dubai then had to continue my journey to the US. One of the flight attendant came to me( I guess she saw me looking miserable) ask me if I was ok I told her I was not feeling Well she left for a while and came back to me to tell me I can't travel I told her no I just want to go home after another while I saw myself surrounded with 4 people from Emirates then the police as if I was a criminal or as if I had a contagious disease. I have never been embarrassed in my life  like that day . They told me we just want a Doctor to check you and see if you can travel I guess none of those flight attendants were not Mullins because if they were they would know what the person feels or look like after that Holy journey. After being checked  by a doctor who gave me nothing but 2 Paracetamol and some inhalation. After all that I knew the plane already left with my hand luggage with all my medication (I am diabetic) .i was really unhappy now I have to book another flight which is going to be the next day; they took me  to a Hotel after I insisted That I can't spend the night on those seats and they told  me the upgrade I made on my return ticket is no longer valid . Fortunately for me they end up accepting that upgrade and gave  me an hotel voucher. I am complaining for the segregation I witnessed on board and they never delivered my holy ZamZam water..  the incident happened in fightEK 234. Looking forward to hear from you.Regards
1024,"I have flown with them twice , the food was awful and the staff just don't bother if your traveling Economy, I complained after waiting 2 hours for my dinner and the steward just ignored me ."
1025,"I'm frequent flyer with Emirates and I must say their service is impeccable, they're very generous with the 30kg baggage allowance, generous rewards including airmiles, the tickets are very fairly priced and the service on board is excellent.........lots of leg space and fantastic inflight experience. Well done and keep up the good work."
1026,"Airline is great, website less so.Finding it hard to make complex bookings only, often getting many error messages."
1027,Pathetic Airline Doesn't care customers and try to rip you off. I  am frequent traveller with Emirates Airline and bought expensive ticket online from Emirates Airline. I was stuck in traffic and was late just 5 minutes for check-in (55 minutes before takeoff time). They not only refused my this leg from London to Dubai but also cancelled subsequent 3 flights because I missed first flight. I was sold new ticket and the change was just the first leg. They made me to pay £932 more for my own seats which I paid already.
1028,Queuing system gives privilege to certain card holders at the cost of ordinary people. I am annoyed sitting in your office being treated like...
1029,"One star as I cannot put a negative star rating. I bought my ticket to fly to Zambia, traveling on a Convention 51 Travel Document. Ensured I did not need a visa to travel via Zambian High Commission and Dubai Embassy as per conditions of travel. Guess what come day of travel refused boarding by Emirates staff at Manchester Airport because I do not have a visa to travel to Zambia. Which visa? Are they now the immigration authority in Zambia? Will not let me fly despite contrary evidence still want visa! Oh they also want me to pay extra for their ignorance and arrogance to catch another flight at a date to be determined by them and to return on my original return date. Am I a fool?"
1030,Very bad customer service. They will just put you on hold and the people who are working at the counter are very rude. If you have any small problem no one will help add to that the bad and rude way of treating.
1031,"If I could give them a 0 I would. This company has the worst ever compassion or customer services. They are abusive, rude and very hurtful. I cancelled my tickets with them and will not be flying with this company. 5 years ago they were a lovely company but now they do not care. Do not let big companies like this get away with hurting and belittling people. There words were ""WE DO NOT CARE"" and the person was yelling down the phone. Can someone start a facebook page with the complaints so that this company may sit up and listen because the only way to make them listen and care is when you pull your money away from them.Also the good comments in between all the back comments are placed there."
1032,"One of the worst airlines I have ever dealt and they only get support because of One of Dubai nothing elseI had experience with the worst checkin, tickets and customer service team. I have checked online and received a message from emirates says please be in the airport before 14:20 I reach 14:15 and the counter say sorry we can't drop your bag as the airplane gate is far a way And we are already done with this flight?????!!!!!! I show him the message and it was useless then he called his manager who asked me to come to her counter and actually that was more useless even:( she give to me one paper with link to the website as says you can complain online we can't do anything !!!!!???? Never recommend it to any oneTo be continued:Second day I want to the airport to catch my new flight and the nice part here ,I am in front of the airplane gate and I received same message you need to pass before 14:20 ?????!!!! I am already passed and on the flight gate.... simply emirates keeps proving that they have the worst system and amateur stuffNever recommend it to any one"
1033,"My wife is supposed to be on flight from Geneva tomorrow and her original flight has been changed without her consent  for a flight which means she has to spend the night at DXB and when she called to complain about the change, Emirates told her it was her negligence which caused the issue. however she has a screenshot of the original booking and it shows which flight she was scheduled on. I believe this is a terrible way to treat your customers after we spend so much money on air fares."
1034,"I tried booking tickets for my mom using emirates.co.in using american express 10% promo - I wasted half a day trying to book a single ticket,I am using a valid american express card - it kept saying card is not valid. I called american express they said it's problem with payment processor of emirates. I tried live chat - it does not work properly in IE and then in google chrome - the person says to come online after 4 hours. I told him here is my mobile number and email id . let me know if the issue is resolved. I tried again after a week- same issue even with a different credit card. I have called emirates customer service spoke with Monica - who initially dropped my call on purpose and after 20 minutes got the same person was not willing to give me the same rate but 80$ more for the same flight.I have spoken to Noman,Jamshed, Jamal and Marie on chat sessions"
1035,"worst ever flightterrible customer service with rude agentscannot choose your own seat, you are assigned a seat!yes people! this is not a democracy! you dont have the right to choose a seat, and if you contact them, they refuse to accept the fact that their website clearly says ""sorry we have technical difficulties"" when you try to choose a seat customer service representative in dallas airport was terribly rude and unapologetic for the clear error on emirates part, he said his name is ""Mohammad Ali"""
1036,"This has been the worst experience ever.  I have taken Emirates in the past and had no issues.  But after my latest experience, I have second thoughts about using this airline. On Friday, July 7, 2017, my husband and I were supposed to board Flight No. EK0202 and depart at 11:00 p.m. Boarding was supposed to start at 10:00 p.m. and nothing was happening until 10:30 p.m. and no announcements were made to notify the passengers who were sitting at the terminal and some of these passengers were with infants and little kids since 8 pm.   Passengers kept going to the gate to find out the status of departure.  Even when the announcements were made, it was hardly audible.  This is the starting point.  Then, we're told the flight is just delayed by 1 hour; the boarding would start at 11 pm; flight will take off at 12 midnight; the lost time would be made up during flying time and passengers will most likely be able to make their transfer fights. Well, the flight didn't take off until 2 am and all passengers were inside the plane for 2 hours and no snacks or drinks were given unless asked.I work in a very reputable health care organization and customer service is number one.  Emirates staff did not exhibit this quality at all. Due to this delay, we didn't make the transfer flight and my husband missed his college reunion after 25 years, which he was planning for the past 4 months. There was NO SERVICE RECOVERY. None of the staff was apologetic about the delay or the situation.  It almost seemed like that Emirates was doing the passengers a favor.  Also, there was no hospitality among some staff.  During the flight, I went up to the crew to get a cup of water.  One of the flight attendant pointed to a tray with 3 glasses (1 glass juice and the remaining 2 glasses were water) sitting in a puddle of juice and said to me ""Take it"".  I asked her, ""Are you sure"" and she responded, ""Yes, it is good water""  I  was repulsed/disgusted by her attitude and I really needed to drink and therefore, I took it and drank it. Towards the end of this flight and close to landing, all flight attendants kept saying there will be clear instructions for the connecting flight.  This was just to avoid all passengers going up to them and asking them serious of questions.Second Trauma: Once the flight landed, passengers were running to the information desk and NO ONE was giving out any clear instructions, NO CLEAR COMMUNICATION about connecting flights.  At the information desk, there were 5 desk stations and 2 of them were solely dedicated to 1st class/Business Class passengers and there were no one in that line. But the staff kept calling anyone from 1st class/business class and that was very annoying.  Instead of helping everyone in the line, the staff was just waiting for 1st class/ business class passengers.  The economy class passengers were treated like herds. NO RESPECT.  Last time I checked I didn't get on this plane for free. More than 200 passengers did not make it to the connecting flight and accommodations were provided and said we take the next flight which was 24 hours later.  We already lost our day.  Also, they advised not to take our luggage and further did not instruct the passengers what to do with the duty free items that were purchased inside the airport and were in sealed bags.  Obviously, frustrated passengers left the airport with the duty free items in their hands.Following day, we go through customs and clearance and obviously, we could not bring our duty free items with us because it was prohibited to have it on the carry on. Even though the items were in sealed bags with the receipts inside the package indicating the flight no, passenger information, we weren't able to bring it in. Then, they point to the items that were prohibited on the plane like we don't know that.  Since this item was purchased inside the airport and kept in sealed bags with all pertinent information regarding the package, we did not think this was an issue. To make a complaint about this situation, we learned that there was NO CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK  at Dubai airport.  Dubai airport is the main hub for Emirates and it was surprising to see no customer service to provide any service recovery.  The Manager at the Emirates service desk at Dubai Airport said to us, ""Make all your complaints online and there is no in person customer service."" Further, he said ""We should have known that there were ways to check in the duty free items before leaving the airport""  Again, there were NO COMMUNICATION given to the passengers who had missed the connecting flights.  24 hours later, we landed at Cochin airport only to find out that none of our luggage (4 pieces) made it to the airport.  So, day 2 is lost without any clothing and after hours of filling out paperwork they handed $100 worth of Indian Rupees to cover for our  clothing (Very generous).   On Tuesday, at 11:30 am our luggage finally arrived and day 3 was lost.  Overall, the entire experience was HORRENDOUS.UNFRIENDLY STAFF, LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND NO RESPECT FOR PASSENGERS AND ABOVE ALL NO CUSTOMER SERVICE."
1037,"My partner and I had the misfortune to fly Emirates Flight EK038 in mid June 2017, from Birmingham to Dubai, with connecting flight EK707 to the Seychelles.Just prior to landing at Dubai International Airport, the aircraft diverted to nearby Al Maktoum airport, apparently due to fog. The pilot said that the aircraft would refuel in about 20 minutes then take off again for Dubai International. However it was 165 minutes later that we actually did take off, and we finally landed at Dubai International three hours late! Consequently we missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles.Emirates representatives at Dubai Airport seemed disorganised, and unprepared to process the hundreds of us who needed rescheduled flights, even though they had had three hours  to prepare, and hence resulted in very long queues for us in order to find out when Emirates could put us on the next flight to our respective destinations. In our case we were queueing for over 160 minutes before being booked on the next flight to the Seychelles (about 2 am the next day) and provided with accommodation in a local hotel.  We were told our suitcases would be sent to the hotel approximately 4 hours later, but that we would need to stay at the hotel until the suitcases arrived so that we could identify them.  However our suitcases never turned up, and we literally spent hours trying to track them down, but not much before the time our flight took off for the Seychelles, so they stayed at the airport with Baggage “services”, some staff of which were arrogant and unhelpful when we went back to the airport to locate our suitcases!  This was not only very inconvenient, it was also frustrating and a significant nuisance as we hadn't been able to leave the hotel or freshen up before returning to the airport to fly to the Seychelles, arriving approximately 18 hours later than we should have, and having paid for a luxury hotel there for the night we were stuck in Dubai!When we complained to Emirates about all of this, including the incompetence of Dubai baggage services,  they were essentially arrogant in their response and offered no compensation of any value!Whilst it could be argued that the fog that had caused the original flight delay was an Act of God, the ensuing problems were caused by Emirates and Dubai Baggage Services! Clearly International travel legislation needs to be strengthened, and more rights given to travellers caught up in such situations, where they are severely inconvenienced and significantly out of pocket, to be able to legally pursue customer unfocused airlines such as Emirates for compensation!Needless to say we will not be flying Emirates in the future, and will do our best to avoid Dubai International airport completely!"
1038,Good Easy to Use and Navigate Website. Information simple to find and can even do UAE Visas on line. However Somtimes has problems Completeing Booking and Payments when being accessed from China. Never had any issues in Hong Kong or U.K. so I believe it is a China Problem.
1039,They let me fly to Vietnam without the proper paperwork. Was deported on arrival.
1040,I tried to have an upgrade to business class but it went wrong spoke to support and that couldn't care about me. Sky Rewards is a joke. I suggest you fly Emirates as a last choice.
1041,The worst service ever! Thieves! Do not use such horrible company!
1042,"I cannot register my miles on this site because my registered name for Skywards Miles is not the same as my passport.....so....they request you change your details by uploading a scan of your passport.Problem.....my scan showed an ""error"" over 1 mb!As it is a Pdf.file it's impossible to compress and anyway unsure it would compress to below 1 mb!Talked to them on the phone and chat,when you finally discover how to..,and there's no contingency process.No email with attachment ,I even offered to send it by mail!Big process issue and probably their inefficiency has cost me many thousands of miles.Unbelievable and they're apparently No.1...!"
1043,"Love flying with this company, their service is second to none."
1044,Customer service 10/10Flights on time: 9/10.DXB airport 10/10.Emirates fleet:10/10Emirates cabin crew service 8/10.Value for money: 7/10. Distinations: 10/10.Emirates into UK airports 10/10.
1045,"Very unhappy with the service. I got a delay for over 4 hours and Emirates is denying the compensation. When I asked for the proofs of the ""justified reasons"" for the delay, customer services just stopped to answer my emails. So disapointing."
1046,"They decline to provide accommodation for a lay over of 23 hours at airport. All the filters and conditions are not very clear in website , When I contacted Customer care , they told your ticket should be minimum XXX $$ , in reply i told I met the condition , Sorry sir this should in USD , Still I didn't get it , I am in Canada & they are in UAE and I paid my ticket in CAD , suddenly where does this USD come in picture ? All the terms and conditions should be clear in website for hassle free travel . Emirates was a classy airline when I first traveled 5 years back , but the service and reputation is declined these days Dont even contact their call center , they are too rude and shut the call without giving a reason Suggestion : Please be clear on terms and conditions in Website , Call Center Guys -- This is a important aspect in customer service , please be nice , atleast pretend to be nice"
1047,I was declined an accommodation with more than 10 hours of stopover in Dubai. The staff and their manager refused even after showing their website reference. Worst airlines I ever traveled.Will never travel again.
1048,Emirates has the worst customer service ever they do not care about their customers only making money!They work along side scam companies
1049,Really quality airline. Sensible pricing at short notice and the 30kg luggage allowance is a great bonus
1050,"Their flights are fine. I'm moving home and need to bags to get all my stuff with me. They wanted to charge me NZD 1700 for 15 ekstra kg!!! Air New Zealand let me add another bag for $35. Now I have to send my luggage through the post office which will be another $400.. I asked if it was not possible to add extra bags and they said ""not for you ticket"". So annoyed and will never use again."
1051,Business class scam!!We upgraded to business for my husbands birthday. Only to get to the lounge and be told your tickets are not eligible. On the day of his birthday ! Emirates ruined my birthday surprise - very disappointed and unhappy. Flew Qatar business last year and the service was A*. I would not recommend Emirates at all. Birthday ruined by sneaky small print !!
1052,"We flew from Copenhagen (Denmark) to Bangkok (Thailand), with a stopover in Dubai. We flew with an Airbus 380 and it had good legroom and wasn't noisy.  Their aircrafts is new and clean and the entertainment system is really good with a lot of opportunities for both children and adults.The cabin crew was so nice and serviceminded."
1053,"I have been using Emirates for over 25 years and have done over 150 trips from UK to Thailand. Over the years the service has just gone from excellent to so poor and Emirates staff treating you like and inconvenience rather than a customer. Well after so many run in's with customers services whom name suggest they are there for customer but they clear ain't I decided that after 9 separate problems on the 2 flight back to the UK I was no longer just accept it and took them to court last week.Well they turned up with a barrister a 100 bundle and loads of test cases, there legal cost must have been £10,000. My bundle was  19 pages  and cost me about £350 in court cost to take them to court. Well of course I lost the money will always win but for the judge to almost apologize because on legal note he had no choice he did say that Emirates had failed very badly on a Customer Service level. Can anyone whom else whom feel let down with Emirates please get in touch as I plan to raise all complaints with there British CEO Sir Tim. In the meantime fly with Qatar as they really seem to want customer and know the values of service. Geoff de Moll"
1054,"Well, flew on Emirates MUC-DXB-MNL and back to DXB-ZRH in Business class in May 2017 on A380 and B777. . Flights were always on time, no delays.Service was excellent on all flights, welcome drinks, hot towels, excellent food and drinks, all brand names like Moet Chandon and Veuve Cliquot etc. Inflight entertainment with hundreds of movies and music to choose from. Flat bed seats, mattresses, pillows, blankets as much as you need. Amenity kits, bathrooms fully equipped. Everything clean and even the bathhrooms were always cleaned and re-stuffed after every pax visit. Not the airlines fault: Avoid Dubai airport. Even medical personnel is extremly slow, transfers are even slower. Sometimes we thought, the next slower walk would only possible backwards...Showers are overcrowded, if possible use in Terminal A, not B, they are much better and cleaner. Don't trust what staff says, if they tell you, you can shower in about 10 mins, don't believe it, stay insistent!Emirates lounge is overcrowded, too, and lacking staff and service. Deckchairs are ALWAYS occupied (some more might be helpful??)Food and drinks are good."
1055,My wife booked a special trip home to see her family with our son. It's his 1st flight. At the time of booking they chose seats that were important for reasons I will not go into here. The were told these seats are theirs.That was October 2016. They have now been told they need to pay a further approximately $400.00 to now confirm these seats. Money which we currently don't have.
1056,"Not what it used to be when we first travelled, customer service is now terrible. They lose luggage get the meals wrong and ignore health & safety issues even when pointed out to them like over head compartment about to drop in mid flight. Flight delays and customer service don't even bother to reply to complaints. Don't think we'll be travelling with these guys anytime soon."
1057,Offloaded 4 passengers by telling us that we need to talk about your daughter sick health.On ground we came to know that we are already beingg off loaded and the document  was handed over to us showed that we got off loded voluntary .I was made to pay for all 4 tickets and took flight after one week with EmiratesComplaint department has nothing to comment on this document which was printed by emirates staff and does not have document that shows we chose to offloaded voluntary .Bunch of liars and a company with no values
1058,"By far the best airline out there today. BA, Virgin, American, etc don't even come close. Emirates has it's act together."
1059,"""Emirates needs to learn to respect it's Economy Class Customers"":The only way to sum up my experience and observations related to Emirates Economy Class: Absolutely pathetic and shockingly bad on every level. Ground Staff and Cabin Crew are rude and arrogant and treat economy class passengers like low class citizens. Worst customer service - in fact don't know how to do their basic job. Violation of human rights and ill treatment of fellow human beings - shocking treatment of customers beyond belief. In this day and age you expect customer service to be the paramount focus and priority but what I have experienced and observed is nothing short of humans in economy class being treated worst than animals. Extremely disappointed to see that while corporates all around the globe are so focused on NPS and customer service, Emirates Economy Class Service quality, food and ground staff and Cabin Crew attitude has deteriorated significantly to the point that it is shamelessly bad.Disappointing to see that no investment is being made on educating the ground staff and the cabin crew on simple basic human etiquettes. Simple rule of successful business in any era is Win the hearts of your customers and you will quadruple your profit margin. Respect ALL your passengers and don't discriminate your passengers based on the class they fly. Disrespect and discrimination is not acceptable in an educated society."
1060,My wife and I recently flew to Mumbai with Emirates. Great customer service all the way. Staff were so helpful when my wife hurt herself on holiday and had to use a wheelchair on the return flights. Well done Emirates and thank you.  We will fly with you again anytime. Frank M
1061,"Depreciation in customer valueI am sad to say after many years and multiple flights with emirates, the status and quality of this airline has consistently declined. Not only customer service, but the planes feel increasingly untidy. It used to be a pleasure, but after my last 3 flights in 2016 (1x 5 hour delay + 1x cancelled flight because of an airplane defect + 1x rudest cabin personal in 20years of flying), i must say that i will try to use other airlines in future."
1062,a horrible airline for people with disabilities booked flatbeds paid extra they changed seats. booked wheelchair which took us to the planeno lift onto plane my disabled wife had to walk up the stairs which on a 380 is a long steep clime it took ages no help i thaugt she was going to have a heart attack. then to ad insult to injury she had to walk to the tail of the plane to get to the seat the upsets to many to mention .in dubai we had to wait on the plane for nearly 2 hours to get off on a lifterno help in dubai from anyone with emirates my poor wife was so upset it spoiled our holiday of a lifetime to africa the saga continued even worse on the way home      thanks emirates  if you are a disabled human please do not fly with emirates we may be getting on but we are not animals
1063,Fabulous food. I flew from Birmingham to Perth WA. The food was lovely. I had ordered vegetarian and was surprised at the thought that had gone into the menu. I would have liked to go on the A380 rather than the B777 but hopefully next time.
1064,"Two passengers paid for the same flight on Emirates Airline and arrived at the check in counter at about the same time.  One was allowed to board and the other was stranded.Which will you be?I booked a flight home from Dar Es Salaam to New York via Dubai on Emirates Airline and arrived at the airport counter from a delayed connection about one hour prior to departure.  Customers to board the same flight arrived at the check in counter around the same time as I did, including seconds before and minutes after I did.  The customer service agents at the counter picked and chose which customers got to board the flight.  They permitted at least one to board, but I and other customers were stranded in Africa.  I have since filed a complaint and was not given a response that explains in total the airline agent's behavior or a refund to compensate for the poor service."
1065,"i have travelled in 2016 on 30 legs and 16 legs with emirates. destinations include BKK, HKG, SIN, DXB, from LGW, BHX. in economy, solo and with family and friends.FOOD: in flight food by far the best in economy. breakfast on flights is not that good, i always choose the omelette, i will try the pancakes when i fly next week. SEATS:long haul i have flown with many airlines, middle eastern, european and american, Emirates seats and thick and spacious, i like to recline and so choose the seats with no one behind me. i can recline without bothering anyone and no idiot can put their smelly feet near my arm rest. ENTERTAINMENT:Always working, i already have in mind what am going to watch next week.movies are upto date, plenty to watch, and internet is 10MB free, slow but works. you can pay for more MB. LUGGAGE:i try to find the best fare, which includes two things, the timings and the price. on the saver fare you get 20kg luggage, and cant select seats with out fees until check in opens. i collect airmiles on the skywards programme, the saver fare gives very little miles. its usually only £30-40 difference each way on a return flight and you get many more miles + 30kg luggage, when i travel alone i travel on a budget so that small amount goes along way, like pay for my food for a week. AIRMILES:emirates has its own airmiles service called the skywards programme. i am still on blue as i spend it in duty free, you can do that now, points are good as cash now. Lovely Jubbly. Emirates seriously needs to clamp down on the department that does the proof reading for their website and the ICE system in flight. and fire someone, mane spelling and grammar mistakes. i have reported to the emirates facebook page but nothing has been updated. overall, i always recommend emirates on routes my family is travelling on."
1066,"We booked a flight from Germany to Asia. Due to a tragic event in the family, we were unable to make this flight. Although the flight could not be canceled, Emirates refunded a large part of the booking costs. The communication worked very well by e-mail. Thank you very much!"
1067,"On 2015 January & February, I made a journey on EMIRATES. I had booked this journey in FIRST CLASS from PARIS to COLOMBO and return to LYON after a stopover in DUBAI. On the two (it was not the same day) return flights from COLOMBO to DUBAI (2015 February 12) and from DUBAI to LYON (2015 February 19), EMIRATES made aircraft swaps (aircraft changes) without warning and without any technical reason or extraordinat circumstance. EMIRATES put a 2 cabins B 777-300 (BIZ & ECO) instead of 3 cabins B 777-300 (FIRST, BIZ, & COACH). So, I was downgraded twice (at different days and on different flights). I asked EMIRATES the refund of the difference of fares (half one of the difference of the ticket prices between FIRST and BIZ as half of the journey had been downgraded). Ticket price difference (FIRST / BIZ with A / I - FLEX FARE) was 2 000 € (about 1 950 $) for the whole journey. So I request EMIRATES a refund of 1 000 € (about 950 $). EMIRATES denied it and made a refund of only 500 € (about 425 $). EMIRATES explained they gave also loyalty skywards for the "" inconvenience "". I did not wanted any loyalty skywards (I have no use of it) but the correct refund. Thanks god : I had kept some screen copies of the day (2014 October 2) of my booking (when I checked prices in FIRST and BUSINESS). The affair lasted some eighteen months ! I had to send the case in French court. Finaly, on 2016 December 16, the court in PARIS (Juridiction de Proximité of PARIS 8) stated that EMIRATES was guilty and had to refund the actual difference of fares (total of 1 000 € I asked). As EMIRATES had refund 500 € the court sentenced EMIRATES to pay 500 € (500 € + 500 € = 1 000 €). EMIRATES, too, was condemned to pay for part of my expenses to rule the case in court (I live at some 700 kilometers from PARIS and I had to booked high speed train tickets and hotel night to be in court). I discovered (on many web forums) how EMIRATES tried not to refund a fair fare difference to its passengers when downgrading them. Also, it seemed that EMIRATES had shocking aircraft swaps when EMIRATES had in mind that there are too few FIRST CLASS passengers scheduled (booked) on some involved flights. When EMIRATES made aircraft swap (B 777-300 from 3 cabins to 2 cabins) EMIRATES can sell some 70 to 80 seats more in COACH ...."
1068,"Refused me on flight due to a 'partial swipe' on my passport that had no physical or visual damage. Had completed API so the information could have manually been inputted. Charged me a flight change fee and the cost of new outbound flights after I went to get passport on the same day. All in all cost me £1200 extra due to a supervisor who didn't consult with anyone else. Complained to Emirates, not even a apology, could not care less and claimed my passport was denied because of water damage. A blatant lie. Never flying with them again and I urged others not too. All the staff I spoke to did not want to work for them either."
1069,Very different now. Years ago with Emirates you got looked after but now they do not care anymore. On flight food was tasteless.wanted to speak to staff but was directed to go online and complain rather than trying to come up with any solution. Got to destination luggage went missing had to wait 3 hours after 9 hours of flight. On my way back got to the airport check in and found out our pre chosen seats had been changed andnow I was sat on upper deck and mum was on lower deck and it was a struggle to get seats together considering I paid £1500 for 2 economy seats. Got home complained about it on emirates website and got an email asking me to wait for 30days to get an answer. Now it has been 40 days still waiting. Very disappointed with Emirates.
1070,Horrible Company to deal with. Flying business back in december the chauffer service never works the ground staff is horrible. The chauffer first didn't call and kept waiting for over an hour. The driver then shouts and tells me to get down to the car or he leaves. This is yes exactly BUSINESS CLASS IN DCEMber WHICH IS QUITE A LOT OF MONEY !!! once on board  a menu given only to find out there is only one option available as they dont have the rest. Again to remind you this is business class service !! THISI S THE WORST AIRLINE THAT TRIES TO PORTRAY AS THE BEST ! avoid at all costs ! I complaint to emirates about this and this on 2 different occasions traveling business class paying highest possible fairs. They also cancelled my seat and put me right at the back of business class the counter lady told me on top you dont pay for the seat just travel. UNBELIEVABLE TO EVEN say that to an economy travel but business class LOL !!!! so much for class service of traveling. Complained and no response what so ever from emirates !
1071,"Booked flights with Emirates because I believed though not cheap, I would be given good service. Having not been provided with a Booking Reference (online check in etc ) I emailed them asking for this simple piece of info. The only responses I get are automated ones referring me to a worse than useless FAQ area of the Company Web Site. The appear to use this as a way of deflecting Customer queries, rather than responding to them."
1072,"Myself and my partner traveled to Thailand with emirates airlines via Dubia. Our luggage was lost for 13 days. As we did not fall into the 2 weeks to get compensation and after almost 100 calls trying to call them from Thailand we gave up trying to get a refund once our luggage was found. Their customer service was the worst I have ever been in contact with! They offer us $50 which we still have not seen or even had any further contract since our return to London. Emirates airlines wasted our money, time and our holiday saving Monday. Will never use again!"
1073,Good everytime
1074,We used emirates  on one of our legs to  Europe  from newzealand and i must say that they were the best planes and extras  con paired to  the 3 others we used  thank you emirates
1075,Wonderful flights to and from Dubai. Great with children. Fantastic meals and drinks service.
1076,"Great service, really nice food on the plane, free drinks and snacks. Brilliant !!"
1077,"I'm a travel agent and as you can imagine I fly a lot. However last week was the first time I've flown with Emirates …and first time in an A380 from Gatwick to Dubai and I must say It was pretty amazing! I gotta say when I arrived to the airport I was not really impressed by the airport employee at the check in- I know it gwasn't Emirates employee but the cold and impersonal way she treated me wasn't really pleasant. However my connecting flight to Perth ( EK424 on the 20th of February ) was a delight! The cabin crew - especially two flight attendants ( unfortunately I do not know their names ) a non stop smiling and helpful gorgeous lady and a carrying and very attentive young Egyptian man. They both went an extra mile and made this long journey very pleasant and comfortable . I guess all the flight attendants should be like them , unfortunately it's not the case. For-some different reasons I can understand yet still I think the service onboard is quite important as it can puts away from returning … On that I hope my return flight on Sunday will be as pleasant as the last one ! Alex"
1078,"Honestly never again. My flight from Lahore to Dubai was suppose to fly at 02:40 on 06/02/2017 but left at 4:30 - was not given any explanation as to why. I was advised that the connecting flight in Dubai would be advised about this but later as I got to Dubai my flight had left. Finding your way around Dubai airport alone if frustrating and on top of that being told that you will have to wait another 9 hours before you can get the next Emirates fight is just not fair for the amount I paid. After waiting nearly 12 hours just o get home, I was still not given an explanation as to why we were delayed so long and missed a days work due to this bad service. I travel about 3-4 times a year but I wont be using Emirates again."
1079,"2 hour flight delay in London- it happens- but when arrived at Dubai airport the nightmare began. Docked Gate A1,designated transit desk  at the far end of area C. Monorail turned off for the day. Nearly an hour to walk the distance. Despite all the flights out to Singapore the next day told nothing for 23 hours. Then robbed in the airport off all travel docs and currency. Police claim nothing on cameras, insistent won't register my theft without my- stolen- insurance document. What is that about? Keeping the crime figures down? Complicity? Put in a terrible hotel by Emirates. Lost property at airport never answer phone. Emirates and Dubai airport one and the same. NEVER EVER WILL I GO ANYWHERE NEAR DUBAI AND I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO DO THE SAME. If you want sun go somewhere else. If you want shops go to Bluewater.On the way back they managed to get a bag not belonging to any passenger onto the flight. Bomb risk and further delay."
1080,"When asking the crew a question they look at you in disgust as if you interrupted a funeral, they look at you like a peasant. Asides from the service and the cabin being outdated departure time was perfect and they all looked perfectly presentable as did the cabin."
1081,"Flight was cancelled till the following day. Given their reason, which we cannot do anything about. We missed connecting flight to our destination as well as one day in the hotel. We have to pay for another flight which was more than 2x the original price. Emirates offered information on refund/compensation  and all that malarkey but, it ended as malarkey. No pressure Loves. I still fly with them as it is still convenient and comfortable, my choice my mistake."
1082,"Emirates were a great company about 5 years ago. Steadily they've got worse and now I have had enough. They now charge you to book your seat and the rewards program is awful. I've flown 10+ times with them last year and got nothing for it!!!! Their cabin crew argue with each other and a lot of their planes are getting very worn. On my last flight the seat was broken and despite being a key safety guideline set by aviation authority they just overlooked this completely. A lot of Emirates flights seem to have a lot of small children and babies on nowadays, so unless you are travelling with kids stay well away."
1083,"I fly with emirates all the time, am a skywards member. I wouldn't choose any other airline"
1084,"Despite lodging a complaint to Emirates, It was absolutely ignored.I on a flight having medical issues wanted to get up and use the bathroom. In front of all the people there the stewardesses aggressively told me to sitdown and ''get back'' in very loud and aggressive terms. I took this complaint to the manager, Rami, who insisted that something would be done but as of yet nothing has.Disgraceful behaviour towards someone with legitimate medical issues."
1085,"I just had another amazing flight with Emirates. The service was great, enough leg-room, and tasty meal-service with free booze - what's not to love?! The staff were super-friendly and it landed on-time as always. Definitely on-par with Qatar and Singapore Airways, my other two favourites. Recommended!"
1086,"If you ask Emirats not to deliver a serviceThe answer will be: You have to pay to cancel your order, even though you have fully paid for undelivered serviceThis is as new as discovering a new specie.You can call it Arab Got Talent"
1087,"They deducted extra money for the fare which allow cancellation without charged. It's been 2 month to follow up why they deducted 350 USD when it allows free cancellation. They never return the money, never gave a reason to deduct.Please take screenshot when you book your ticket for proof, they are stealing money now."
1088,"Just as the title says, what's the matter girls? Why the attitude? Also had a situation where we checked in online, then when we got to the airport were dumped in a middle isle seat, we had selected a window seat. Left my bangle at Dubai airport as I was rushed through security like someone's life depended on it. I only use this airline as a last resort, otherwise I use an airline that will at least pretend they are happy to serve me."
1089,"Flew  Emirates to Abu Dhabi, we had great service wonderful seats and very helpful staff. My wife has food allergies and they were able to cope with these on the way out. Unfortunately, I'm not sure if they got the message about the allergies for the return flight, even though the staff were helpful, there was little for her to eat. Overall good but need to pay attention to the details"
1090,"Hi, My Name is M. J.GeelleI was travelling from Hyderabad To Dubai on 29-30/July 2016 when I landed in Dubai I could not find my bag and I inform them that my bag is not here. the asked me a lot of info and documents and I give everything they asked after 3 weeks I contacted them again by phone Emirates told me that they don't have my bag and I don't have any right to request for compensation because you did not report it. they again asked me all documents which I already gave them, and I send them second time again.I tried to contact by e-mail and I don't get any answer back, when I call them they always told me we will contact you can you please send us more info. it is really headache and I cant just ignore my back in contains more 4500 dollars of goods and medicine and documents.I hope I will get here some one give me any idea how I can reach the real customer service of Emirates or any office that I can send my complains please"
1091,"I flew long haul to japan (2 flights) was happy with my meal and entertainment, being a taller chap I felt the only letdown was the leg room the seats are cramped."
1092,"I never write many reviews about airlines usually but after experiencing the first hand unprofessional manner of the check in staff, I've decided it is time for a review.No complaints regarding the rules they follow but it is a lack of concern for a parent travelling with an infant. My wife travelled today with our 9 month old son from Dublin to Hyderabad with a stopover at Dubai. We just packed everything as per the dimensions/weight as mentioned in the baggage allowance. At the check in, we requested the staff to see if it is possible to checking my wife's handbag as it will be difficult to carry the infant, the buggy, the changing bag and the handbag as well. She wouldn't have taken the handbag at all if it was not because of the length of the trip and we didn't want to miss out on something that isn't available in India. The staff at the check in counter bluntly said that it is not possible to check in the hand baggage. We've requested again explaining the rationale behind our request that the bag will anyways reach Hyd either as check in or hand luggage but it is a matter of convenience as she is travelling with an infant. She still said no and refused to check in the same. She said the reason for the same is that if she allows it for us, everyone would expect the same. I wondered how anyone would expect the same if they aren't in our situation and that very few people would travel with infants and they wouldn't certainly be aware of that favour that they bestowed on us to base their request on our situation. And to add to this, she suggested that we buy additional check-in luggage to check in the hand bag. And then it became evident that all this denial of the favour was just to push to extract more from the passengers.I've read in some places that Emirates is one of the most child friendly airlines. To them and others, I would like to suggest that it is not.For anyone from the airlines, if they want to know more of this, the booking reference is KCSA7N."
1093,"I recently flew Manchester/Mauritius in business class with Emirates and the return leg from Mauritius to Dubai was the worst flight I have ever had.  The main course meal was inedible and the cabin crew ignored us completely after I complained.  I wrote the UK VP about the service and he didn't even bother to acknowledge the letter, instead passing it on to customer services who themselves failed to respond to the specific complaints.  Instead their reply read like marketing speak peppered with assurances they had passed on my comments for further investigation.  Given I had a similar bad experience with Emirates several years ago and got similar assurances, I have no confidence things will change.  Their service at its best is very good, but so often it isn't and its that inconsistency and failure to treat me like a valued customer that means I would never fly with them again."
1094,"went to New Zealand and Australia business class with them - lounges worldwide were fabulous, airline was fabulous, staff were fabulous.  Best airline EVER"
1095,"The whole process was smooth from booking to boarding the plane.The flight was so comfortable and the food and service was first class.  The Movie channels were so much better than other airlines, there was 100s of movies to watch on the flight.  However on the way home there was a bit of trouble with one of the passengers and the airline staff handled it brilliantly.  Would definitely recommend them.."
1096,It has been over two years since I contacted the Emirates customer service team requesting a copy of their customer complaints procedure and the name of their regulatory body before proceeding with a formal complaint. I also requested that the matter be dealt with by a manager.Customer service representatives Sherlin Libanan and Swinnie Buchere have responded numerous times now asking for the same information I gave in my initial enquiry. It is also worth noting that they are not managers and have failed to provide me with the documentation requested. I am incredibly disappointed with the level of customer service I have received and simply wish to escalate this to a manger.
1097,"Simply excellent, both in terms of quality and service. It is refreshing to find an airline that is genuine about it's customer relations."
1098,"The people at Emirates were are only competent and courteous, they were also the only airline that I have a good experience from when flying pregnant."
1099,"Really excellent service from start to finish, flying from one end of the earth to the other could not have been better. Customer service was top notch and the cabin crew brilliant. Can't wait for my next flight."
1100,"I'm 10+ years a very regular BA/Oneworld flyer.  Never had many complaints apart from BA only flying long haul from Heathrow/Gatwick which are difficult/expensive to get to on public transport. A friend recommend I try Emirates, as they offer routes from Birmingham. Price seemed reasonable so I booked. Now shortly before my trip they have cancelled my second leg and the replacement flight leaves me with a 7h45 layover in Dubai, the world's coldest, most inhuman transfer terminal.I was, of course offered a full refund if I wanted, but so close to my trip this is a hollow offer, as replacement flights on any other airline will have ramped up to cost a fortune, plus I have made all other arrangements around the flights. The 7h45m is an important number, as if it were 8hours I'd apparently be allowed lounge access in DXB so I could at least have some food+drink, a shower, and set my laptop up. They were unwilling to move on this. When booking I could have picked cheaper flights for a longer layover, including several other airlines, but I needed to be back at BHX for a connecting flight. Now I've got a long layover, no compensation, and my returning weekend plans are in ruins.Have to add that Customer Services are not great - rude and difficult to understand - a massive contrast to the friendly and banterous BA lot. Thank you Emirates. Should have stayed with BA."
1101,I recently had to cancel a flight with Emirates; the staff were courteous and helpful.They went that extra mile to make my refund a smooth transactionThank you so much for all your help
1102,"Overall I'm satisfied with Emirates so far, they have the most convenient routes for me UK to Dubai. Their staff is accommodating, good flight facilities although the planes are more outdated than others I've experienced. Customer service is decent, so in general a good effort."
1103,Frequent traveller to Australia. Normally use Qatar Airlines but as they don't fly into Brisbane used Emirates after a 6 year break. Will not be using them again. They image they portray of themselves is not the reality of travelling with them.
1104,"I have used Emirates off and on for 12 years but there are now too many bad experiences :(First they started and changed all the airmile bonus's which immediately opened the door for other companies.Then I had a flight canceled in Glasgow some years ago, put up in a hotel for the night, they then lost my luggage and when I complained I was told take 25k airmiles which was now worth nothing. I couldn't even get an upgrade LOL. Pointless. 24 hours lost off my holiday, jammed on a stinking (and I mean stinking) Thai air flight from dubai to BKK and told to beat it. So 25k of airmiles for a lot of annoyance and discomfort which I simply lost as never used them :( Poor poor show.Anyway, that was 6-7 years ago. Flew this time and ended up with a glass of water over me followed by a bottle of wine off my head. Damn painful. Accidents happen I know. But care should be taken when handling heavy solid objects.With companies like KLM now offering cheap larger seats, cheap upgrades and additional option coupled with cheap airfares  ......Yes, emirates offers you a large weight to travel with but sometimes it simply doesn't cut it."
1105,"I will never fly with Emirates again. The service on board Emirates Airlines EK 343 to Dubai from Kuala Lumpur 04.03.2016 was terrible.   The flight with the world's largest airplane, which should have been a once in a lifetime experience for my son and I, turned into a nightmare when my son got boiling water on his foot.The incident happened when I was served some instant noodles. A few minutes after I had asked for noodles I got a bowl of scalding hot water. The bag with aroma flavor was not even in the bowl and the noodles had not been left to stand and cool down. The water was scalding hot (probably near the 90-100 degrees Celsius).The bowl of noodles feel down. The boiling water hit me on the stomach and my son's right foot. Thank goodness we had a blanket on us. Otherwise the burn would have been much worse.My son got a second degree burn on his foot. The skin was red and dark. There were blistering and an area of 0.5 * 1 cm of skin was burned off. It is totally unacceptable that we were served boiling hot water on board Emirates Airlines. Instant noodles should stand for at least 5-10 minutes before being served to your passengers. I think it is a thoughtless and irresponsible behavior from your air crew that we were served scalding hot water. The flight with Emirates Airlines was a traumatic experience for both my son and me. I had expected much better service on board the Emirates A380.I have complaint to Emirates Customer Services regarding the episode, but I did not receive an acceptable response from Emirates Airlines. Ahmed Roshdy from Customer Affairs was rude and arrogant and the Airline will not take responsibility for serving boiling hot water with their noodles. People, who have good advice on how to take legal actions against Emirates Airlines for this episode, are welcome to write a private message to me on Facebook"
1106,"As experienced international travelers, we cannot give high enough acclaim to the extraordinary customer service we have received from Emirates. Recently, we had a very complex booking to make. Emirates Customer Service not only were exceptionally professional and thoroughly knowledgeable as to every detail of our booking and inquiries, but went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction. As one example among many, the representative from the New York office called us back later in the day to notify us the payment had officially cleared. Every detail from beginning to end, including the Dubai Connection package our flights qualified for, was handled very efficiently. We sincerely thank and appreciate the Emirates team."
1107,"After using Emirates from more than 20 years I have come to the decision to never use them again, and this is purely down to the arrogant nature of their customer services - I don't know if they are just trained to be rude or if they have just hired people where the only job requirements were; no manners, lack of English skills, lack of personality and must think they are right 100% of the time!Over the years I've had to contact them for various things. I've always been initially polite, provided all the info they needed and been understanding - but looking back over my contact history it has shocked me that they have never once accepted responsibility and that on 3 occasions I had to follow up with them multiple times to get a reply.The latest incident was about credit card charges. My wife and I have the Emirates Visa & Amex for air miles (we use/used Emirates a lot!).You get double air miles for using your Emirates Amex to book on Emirates with it, only this time they decided to charge an extra £5 per person for using the credit card - effectively making the miles worthless since they are not worth the £15 for the 3 people. They admitted that they dont charge this for the Emirates card customers.This is a new charge they added, what is even worse is that you can pay by PayPal without a surcharge and I could have used my Amex to fund the payment (but would not get the double points).Once again contacting customer services and immediately denied even charging us the fee! Given that we supplied the booking references which clearly show the fees it would have been a simple task for them to quickly check we were correct. But no, 3 emails later and they still never checked the booking reference and started to blame the £5 fee on the bank (as in they didn't charge the £5 fee - we must have been charged £5 by our own bank). What a useless person we were dealing with! Now I got their attention, they called me after requesting this several times. After more denial from the person I eventually managed to get them to do their job and look at the booking, only to see that YES we HAD been charged the fee! But now its another 24 hours before they get back to us.So for the sake of £15 which I don't really care about they have lost a long time flyer purely because I do not have any confidence in them anymoreIt should have been 1 simple email pointing out their mistake and 1 simple email in return; a polite apology and refund - case closed.Sorry Emirates, your planes have got better but your customer service definitely hasn't."
1108,"Although I generally can't fault the service on the planes and in the lounges, I am very surprised to see that when things do go wrong a company as large as Emirates DOES NOT follow it's own T&Cs. I clearly pointed out where they didn't and instead of discussing they first try to argue with different contract terms ... um, no you can't just decide to ignore a term in your OWN T&Cs because it doesn't suit.Then when you suggest going to an ombudsman as perhaps 3rd party can resolve better after looking at situation from outsider's point of view, they tell you ""Well we can go to the Ombudsman, but it won't help you"" .. They even go against what the CAA state.Loved travelling on their planes, but if a company cannot follow it's own Terms and Conditions, it is NOT company to be trusted. I'll certainly do everything I can to avoid having to use a company that doesn't understand the basic concepts on legal contracts. ."
1109,"Indeed yes, this company should be highly rated for the kind and quality of services that they provide to their customers. If an airline company that should be chosen as the best airline in the world,then without a doubt it should be EMIRATES. I am talking based on my own experience which go back more than 14 years of flying with Emirates and flying many times a year."
1110,"My first flight with Emirates was 18th April, Milan to Dubai. As we entered the plane I was so impressed with the decor and size of the seats. The flight was great, the food, too. The flight attendants helped to make this flight memorable, Anieski who explained the benefits of Emirates Skyward miles, Javier who was always helpful and smiling. Another memorable moment was my wife getting a birthday cake and champagne and being sang Happy Birthday  by Bertha and Joanne who went on to take a polaroid which they then  gave her in a little folder. Apparently, if your flight is to celebrate a special event you can order a celebration cake. They won't promise it, just promise to try.As we were travelling on to Mauritius, we had another flight with Emirates to arrive at our destination. Of the four flights, (two there, two back) 3 were fantastic, the last one, (a shared flight with Quantas), in comparison to the others, left a lot to be desired. A LONG LONG bus trip to the plane, older plane and smaller seats. even the staff on this flight seemed to care less, as if they were on a second rate flight. Emirates sells the idea of quality, luxury but this leg of the trip was a long way off from that."
1111,"You can lose 150 € even u are in allmost dead in a hospital( if no show i think u lose everything).On internet if u want change ur flying date ( if u are allowed to) , it gonna cost u 100 € , if u failed to do it the first time , they block u if u try again !when u go to a travel agency ( in thailand) it's 25 € more.I call this a rip off .And what about that 30 minutes bus drive from the airplane to the airport ( and vice versa)I think they gonna lose a good custommer !"
1112,"After several trial on with other airlines i think i have finally found the best customer service ever! Alfonso ( Call Center) & Ingrid ( Chat Assistance) did an amazing job and were extremely understanding and took their time to explain all the benefits and rules of the fare i have booked. Keep it up! There's honestly no secret why you were elected for many consecutive years now Best Airline company! AMAZING !"
1113,"I recently booked flights for our holiday with Emirates as I had heard they have great service and planes. Me and my partner were let down majorly. The first flight was a disaster as we were sat opposite sides of an airbus! Not a great start and although we booked Emirates it was a Qantas flight?! Never the less we were excited to be going away so we did as brits do and got on with our seats. Due to the flight being merged, they were short staffed and did mention it but I was happy watching the entertainment. The food came and I cant comment on the quality as the clumsy hostess spilt apple juice across my tray into my lap and not a small amount, leaving my jeans soaked and the FABRIC seat sodden. I asked her to help me by taking the food tray and getting a towel and she said she would WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED THE MEAL TROLLEY? What is wrong with people? I then went to the toilet to try and rinse the apple out as had connecting flights and did not fancy sitting in sticky mess. I came back aprox 30 min later after an attempt to dry them to find nothing had been done about the seat. I asked a member of staff to help and she said because of turbulence I must return to my seat. I can understand safety concerns but I refused to sit in the wet seat. She got the head hostess who said its a full flight so I would have to sit there. I was shocked they didn't try and help or just give me a towel to soak it up, instead she said don't worry things dry quicker in a plane! And that is just half way into our first flight. I asked for a meal as I sat in a crew chair and was told food had been served and that I couldn't sit in the cabin chair. I walked towards my seat to hear two girls moaning about how people were 'so annoying' today. This is bot the service I was sold so I decided to go speak to my partner and explain what had happened. She was not so polite with the staff as I was but they managed to find me a new seat.. on a full plane, which now miraculously is not full! I was fuming but glad to get off the airbus of despair. The following flights were sold to other companies so in total we had 4 airlines and left disgusted by the whole trip. Never again, not even an apology at the desk. I will be taking this further."
1114,"I recently had a bad experience with Emirates - allocated wrong seats, rude staff etc. My biggest gripe now is the complete lack of customer service that emirates exuded. A computer generated email indicating they had received my complaint. Nothing since, not even an apology. Then wrote a letter to management and 4 weeks later still waiting a response. You want an airline that cares about its passengers, forget emirates."
1115,"okay you can make a SPECIAL rule saying weight of laptop is counted within the 7kg cabin luggage. these scammers killed 15 minutes of time weighting my luggages and looking for security staff to sort out my imitation sword when i was checking in, and in the last minute of check-in counter closed, they suddenly said they have to weight my laptop bag and ripped me off £150.  one of their staff rudely say either pay for it or not getting on the flight. Cheat me once, shame on you. Cheat me twice, shame on me."
1116,"Believe it or not, when I took the flight to Dubai it was severly delayed due to FOG in Dubai, and missed my connecting flight. Whilst I understand that the fog was not their fault, the way they dealt with the 1000s of stranded passenger at Dubai airport was, to put it mildly, just disgraceful. The staff were not trainned to the expected high standrads of other airliners such as Vrgin / ANA, etc - for example their knowledge of airports near the destination was very poor and as a result missed more connecting flights than was necessary. Also the ticket counters were extremely under staffed, made worse by staff just disappearing for 20-30 minutes whilst serving the customers. On one occasion the staff who was serving the lady in front of me disappeared for over 40 mins - later we found out from the assistant in the next lane that she had apparently left for the day! That's typical Arab hospitality for you! I was on a vacation so it was not too bad - I spent the extra day wandering about in Dubai BUT I would have been devastated if I had booked the flight for business purposes - I don't think I would ever fly emirates for business purpose - their customer service is just unacceptable.   To add insult to injury, my complaints and request for compensation (at least on three occasions) have all been ignored.   To be frank, in comparison, travelling by Easyjet seems to be a class or two above."
1117,"Had a reserved seat according to my preference, and even the corresponding boarding pass as I checked in online. At the gate they told me that my seat ""had to be changed"", printed a new boarding pass and put me in the middle of a 3-row for a 7-hour flight. Until this point it is not a huge problem.However, I filed a complaint on their website, got the email confirmation that they will reply as soon as possible - and 21 days later they still didn't do that. I believe major transport providers should be routinely tested for customer support quality, and if they simply ignore a complaint they should be fined. UPDATE: After 32 days, they replied. They wrote me a generic description that ""window/aisle preferences made at booking are not always guaranteed, and may be altered at check-in"" - completely ignoring the fact that I have already checked in and had my printed boarding pass in my hand. Conclusion: It takes their ""customer service"" 32 days to leave you a generic reply that doesn't reflect to your problem."
1118,"Since my first intercontinental flight, I have been using only emirates. Sometimes passengers face problems with broken or inadequate earphones."
1119,I found the same flight cheaper elsewhere. They didn't honor their price match deal. I emailed them with a screenshot.Customer service not interested.
1120,They completly destroyed one of my suitcases and would not pay compensation. I can not recommend them in any way.
1121,"I've flown the Birmingham to Dubai route many times with Emirates and have always enjoyed it. New airplanes in excellent nick and pretty good service on board. Food is fine too in economy. The entertainment system is 1st class and that helps a lot on long journey. After one horrid experience with Qatar Airways I'll stick with Emirates from now on. Their frequent flyer scheme is pants though."
1122,"Shortly before I was due to fly to Melbourne with Emirates last December, I suffered a severe attack of sciatica, which necessitated my being wheelchaired on to the plane. We had paid an extra A$180 for me to have a bulkhead seat, so that I could get up and move around whenever necessary, but I noticed that the boarding pass was for a seat different from that booked. I pointed it out to the ground staff, who assured me it “was a better seat”. It wasn’t. It was an ordinary aisle seat. What made things worse was the passenger in front of me on the last leg of the journey from Dubai to Melbourne. He reclined his seat virtually into my lap, making it impossible for me to leave my seat. I asked the Qantas stewardess (it was a Qantas/Emirates collaboration) to request him to adjust his seat, but her reply was: “The poor lamb’s been asleep since Dubai and I’m not going to wake him”!! I therefore had to hoist my sciatic leg over the arm of the seat and clamber out, by which time I was feeling very weak and wobbly. I made my way to the restroom, put down my bag next to the sink and, when I turned round, the automatic tap had come on and filled my bag, ruining two smartphones and all the other contents. I was also soaked through and ended up arriving in Melbourne looking “tres chic (not!)” in grey airline pyjamas. Because of the way I was treated on the plane, the sciatica became worse instead of improving and three visits to the physio in Melbourne confirmed that my condition had been exacerbated by it. I was unable to walk during my entire holiday and, on returning to London, had numerous x-rays, MRI, scans, physio and acupuncture to try and relieve the pain. I notified Emirates and was told that they had dealt with the matter internally and was sure I would not expect to be told what action had been taken. Well, yes, actually I very much wanted to know and wrote back to tell them and also to request compensation. They said that, as a “gesture”, they would refund the A$180, but I pointed out this was NOT a gesture but the refund of a service they contracted for, but did not deliver, therefore a breach of contract. I asked for the entire correspondence to be sent to their CEO and, when I heard nothing, emailed it directly to him myself. Needless to say, I have heard nothing from them. This was my third trip to Australia with Emirates and, if their CEO had responded positively, I would have considered another. However, due to their cavalier attitude, I will never travel with them again and, if you have any disability whatsoever, I would advise you to find a more sympathetic airline."
1123,"So; I've been trying to book return ticket from Copenhagen-Dubai-Sydney. Im attending a friends wedding, but can only be in Australia for 6 days due to work commitments, and had decided on flying business clacc, so I can turn up at the wedding well rested. But booking the tickets online proved impossible; I constantly got the same message: 'Sorry, due to a technical error..blah blah...contact your local Emirates office'. So I called the local Copenhagen number and ended up speaking to a lady in Delhi. She denied the website having any problems, and asked me to try again. This continued for a couple of weeks. I tried different search engines, servers, etc etc, and had ongoing chats with the very nice but equally very inept staff in Delhi. I wasn't reall getting anywhere, and really wanted to book my flights, so I called one more time, and tried to explain my problems once again -eventually a male staff helped me reserve the tickets over the phone. He advised that taking payment over the phone is illegal however, and asked me to go to my local Emirates office to pay. This I can understand, and accepted gladly -the office is in the Copenhagen city centre, and I went on my way.I got to the office at around 12:20-12:25ish. Nice location, BIG sign next to the door letting me know that they're open from 9AM til 5PM on weekdays. Perfect. But the door is locked, and the reservations desk behind the glass door looks deserted. I can see app 10 staff in the back office callcentre, and walk round the building to knock on the window, after which a young chap appears at the back door. I let him know my business, to which he hesitantly replies: '...eh...ahem...we're closed now. But we'll be open in...20 minutes..'. I proceed to ask him if its every day that they open at 12:52, or just today? Because I think that if that's the case then the sign next to the door should be altered -OPEN EVERY DAY 12:52-17:22 for example. He gets the sarcasm and tells me its because the reservations girls have gone for lunch. No kidding, those were his words. I was lost for words, and he closed the door on me. I have now booked my ticked by calling the call centre in Delhi, giving my creditcard details along with full name, date of birth and card security code to a complete stranger on the other side of the planet. The member of staff I spoke to said that unless I wanted to go back to the local Emirates office, then that's the only way.So Im off on my flight in late October, which cost me around Dkr 33.000,00 return. I have zero expectations to the rest of my Emirates adventure, but I guess the service cannot be worse that what Ive experienced so far.Or can it?I'll let you know!"
1124,"Let me begin my saying that I had maintained to the agent continuously for a lengthy time whilst trying to quickly book a couple of tickets to India after learning of my father in laws passing. My wife had already gotten visa's last year for five years ,but, I did not. I was going on the assumption that you could get your entry visa when you arrive at the airport when I arrive in India... Anyway I had told this to the agent ,who proceeded to book my tickets and happily accepting my credit card and charging the full amount to it immediately. That should have been clue number one and the second clue should have been when the agent did not know what was a bereavement fare!!! After getting of the lengthy phone call I was happy to inform my sister who told me that I could only get the visa's at certain Indian airports and not all.In my case I would have to make entry to Mumbai first in order for me to receive the entry visa and not where I had booked my tickets for which was Ahmedabad...I had been assured by the agent that I was safe to cancel my tickets within 24 hrs of purchase with no cancellation charges.This was when I gave him my credit card for purchase. As you can imagine I was shocked when I was told that is not the case when I tried to cancel the tickets. I was informed that this is not so and that it was 7 days prior to departure that I would not be charged at all. Now one agent is telling me yes and the other no. To my disgust I was informed that they will have to an investigation now. The second agent also informed me that they will call me within 24 hrs of their decision,once they contact the other agent. It is now past that and going onto 36hrs or so... Now my issue is that when an agent of such a large airline with such good standing with the public appoints an agent to sell the public a ticket, should they not be aware of all the rules no matter what language they learn from..Why is it that now I have no contact and out of pocket expenses due to an agents promises of something that might be or might be not true. He did his job my selling me the tickets of which he probably got commission for.I am not in the industry of selling airline tickets but if I was I would not be giving false information to customers who are spending hard earned cash to simply fly for whatever occasion. Furthermore,the agent should have also known the fact that I would not be able to get the visa I was speaking of as I later found out that you need to make an online application 4 days prior to departure. If indeed I had known this fact then I would have not been foolish to go ahead and book the tickets. Who do we believe in this case as two agents have two totally different cancellation policies? You might say I should have read the fine print! Indeed that is true but In a time of distress and the urgency of purchasing the tickets and getting to my father in laws house in India took presidence over lengthy airline rules and regulations. DEAR EMIRATE AIRLINES,  I am still awaiting your response to my call yesterday morning the 30th of June 2015. It is now 5.30pm July 01 2015. If you now tell me that I did not call within 24hrs to cancel as i only have proof of my call to your head quarters,and that you make more excuses,well you know the rest .My money does not grow on trees for your agents information..."
1125,"Our flights were all on time, my vegetarian meal was tasty. Seat on the A380 is comfortable with plenty of leg room. The crew could walk a bit more often with drinks but all in all, I had pleasant experience with Emirates."
1126,"The most frustrating experience of my life. This lead to a back and forth between Emirates and BudgetAir.  I had an issue with my ticket leading to it needing to be reissued. No one would take responsibility for the ticket neither Emirates or BudgetAir instead they sent me back and forth each claiming that the ticket belonged to the other and that the other would be reissuing the ticket.  After holding for many hours on the phone with both companies what irritates me the most is that I wasn't able to fly cause the issue was never fixed despite claims of it having been fixed only to be told at the airport that it isn't fixed.  Now neither company will reply to my emails requesting a refund and stand firm on the fact that they can't issue a refund that the other company should do it.  I WOULD ADVISE NEVER USE EITHER! Should lord forbid anything go wrong they will take no responsibility and be of no help what so ever.  If you can I suggest recall the payment so that you don't face issues when it comes to refund as well"
1127,"I found a cheaper rate for a flight on an external site, and was tempted to book with them. But I thought that it might be better to book on the Emirates site. I checked out the best rates policy, and they do have a policy to price match any better prices you can get.  Unfortunately, when it came down to it, the price match was refused. Why? Because I used PayPal, which was not an accepted mode of payment on the site with the cheaper price. My PayPal takes payments from my Debit card.   This was their response: ""After reviewing the details you have provided, we regret to inform that we are unable to grant a refund of the difference between our fare and the one which you have seen on the other website. Based on the terms and conditions for United Kingdom's Emirates Best Price Guarantee, we will refund the difference between the Purchased Fare and the Third Party Fare if they are under the same currency, which include all taxes, fees, surcharges and charges applied to the payment method used for the purchased fare. It shows that you have purchased your ticket on our website using PayPal, and upon checking the payment methods on the website you have mentioned, that same option is not offered."""
1128,"The most terrible flight experience I have ever had - and me who thought that the cheaper it gets, the worse it gets, but unfortunately no - Emirates is the worst company I have ever flown with. First of all I had to SHARE my meal with my sister - (I really dont mind that normally cause its my sister) - but when I have paid nearly £700 I do expect a meal on my own. The reason is that we were on the back row and as we don't like fish, and they ran out of chicken, and only had one left, then we could only have this one. We and 10 others experienced the same.  On my flight out there - the same happened, I really wanted omelet, but they didnt have anymore, so I got scrambles eggs. I dont mind, as its eggs, BUT when I pay so much money for my travels, I do care a lot. Then have more food on board, make people decide when checking in etc. so you are able to have the food we are expecting and that you are announcing in your menu card.  Apart from that the air hostess was totally rude, she just didnt care enough to make up our horrible experience. We tried nicely to get in touch with her, to ask if she had something else we could get, but she just came back with a rude comment: I don't have any other food, get it? We then asked politely to get 2 baileys, she only had one to serve us, because they also ran out of that.  This is just way over the line. I do expect to get some kind of excuse, refund, upgrade or what ever you are able to give. Its just not good enough that I 3 times during my flight with you (who are telling the whole world that you are the best airline - you are just NOT!!! - learn from other companies such as Turkish airlines or others which are truly amazing) is able to come up with the excuse that because Im on the back row Im not as important as on the first row. Cause you are not able to provide me the service and food I am paying for."
1129,"My husband and I had booked return flights with Emirates going from CPH to DXB and DXB to BKK. Emirates promotes itself as one of the best airlines in the world with impeccable service so we were looking forward to our flight and curious to get the “Emirates experience”.  We are frequent flyers and usually fly Thai going to Bangkok but this time we had decided to give Emirates a go. What a mistake! Technically, everything was fine. The aircrafts were new with a clean, modern cabin with plenty of comfort in economy class. Check in was smooth and easy, we departed and arrived on schedule and got our baggage when we arrived. But here the good experience ends. The female cabin crew (with a few exceptions) on ALL 4 flights were shockingly appalling. They were all extremely young and seemed very unprofessional. First of all, they were impolite and almost hostile towards economy passengers; when one of the female cabin crew had to pass me, while I was queuing to get to my seat during boarding, I was pushed. She did not say excuse me or anything but simply pushed me with a cold and unfriendly face. What a welcome! Not a very good start.  It was very hard to detect a friendly face or even a hint of a smile on the female cabin crew’s faces. They all acted like it was a real drag to serve in economy class and did not seem to be aware or care of the fact that they actually are supposed to provide a service to the passengers. Instead, they acted like little divas and spoiled princesses. Rude with a very bad attitude. Serving dinner seemed to be a very complicated matter for these red-lipped girls. It took ages before we got our food, and drinks arrived long after we had finished our meal. Their memory was also seriously lacking, - we had to ask for things at least three times before something happened. And at other times we simply gave up after having asked several times.  There is absolute nothing exceptional about the service in Emirates economy class. There were two choices on the menu but halfway through the serving, the cabin crew ran out of the most popular items on the menu. Not a major issue but it makes you think when this happened on all 4 flights and the airline prides itself of impeccable service and attention to detail. In addition, the meals were of a poor quality. Tasteless and weird combinations. Cheese crackers and salsa? It may sound like we are very fussy and demanding passengers. But we are most certainly not. My husband is a commercial airline pilot and we have a deep respect and understanding for cabin crew’s work. We are generally very large, polite and friendly, and hardly ever ask for anything during a flight.  I must admit that it was the general attitude of the female cabin crew which really made me angry. When I went to the toilets, the female cabin crew were constantly gossiping loudly, they were sitting on the floor eating potato crisps and did not seem to care at all. They did not check the toilets regularly; paper was not refilled and there was always water and pee everywhere.  On one of the flights, a passenger was sick and threw up in the cabin. Obviously, this is not the nicest experience for the passenger or the cabin crew, but I suppose that handling situations like these are part of the cabin crew’s job. Well, they did help the passenger and cleaned up but shortly after, you could clearly hear the girls talking loudly about the unfortunate passenger and how disgusting it was etc. I just could not believe my own ears. Not a hint of empathy, kindness or professionalism."
1130,We flew with Emirates from Stockholm via Dubai to Mairitius 14-15 / 3 (158/703) and return 02-03 / 4 (704/157) We had previously been promised seats because of certain needs. 3 of 4 flights were not these seats excisting It became very difficult and unpleasant staff on site did not help. The food on board was served long before the drink that came afterwards ?? At the start of flight 704 was folded table and 3 cargo hatches in the roof was open. On landing low childs and slept in the seats without clamped although the staff saw all deficiencies. Very poor security practices. Very long bus ride to the airport of Dubai by flight 703 & 704. At three of the four flights we could not choose food even though there was a menu to choose from ???? Worst company ever
1131,"Went on a flight, Taipei - Dubai. It was no good. The plane was worn out and dirty. I could not adjust my seat. The service was missing. Far to tired and short staff, for that long flight. Food tasted bad. Did not look tasty and did not taste good.I would recomend EVA or China Airways if you going to Taipei. Its anoying with all the advertising they do, try to give a false off impression off what they realy are. Thet not live up to what they promiss. The flight Dubai - Copenhagen was a litle better. But I think Emerates are to big, to care about service?The Dubai airport is also far to big and a mess. You spend half an hour in the bus who takes you from the plane to the airport terminal and then its walking and transit with train there."
1132,"You can never go wrong with Emirates.To fully enjoy Emirates, try them on one of them long flights. You will love it. Great service."
1133,"I flew several times to Asia with Emirates and always experienced exceptionally high standards regarding food, service, entertainment and overall experience."
1134,"Flew Birmingham to Dubai 27th January and found this flight to be one of the worst I have experienced. No hot towels given out to us, food trays took for ever and passengers behind us had finished theirs before we were given ours. Waited 3 hours before being given a drink which is unacceptable. Food trays not collected. No hot drinks and snack given out before landing even though promised in menu. Terrible service by cabin crew"
1135,"What else to say....when we checked in, our luggage was almost in perfect condition, used for sure, and now 20/30% less refund??For not only damaged, but heavily destroyed????"
1136,"We flew from Copenhagen - Dubai - Male and return by the same route. The food was great, and it felt like we were serviced all the time. Either we were given hot cloths to freshen up ourselves, else we were given food or beverages. Whenever you needed something, they were there.Their entertainment system is incredible. Really good screen solution and lots and lots of movies, games and tv series to choose from. You could also attach your phone, tablet or whatever via USB to the screen. It was amazing!"
1137,"So I am delayed, nothing new  They shift us from the main airport in to a human loading bay otherwise known as the gate  no toilets, not one announcement from the airline just left to sit and wait.  So i ask the staff why and more importantly why move us to the gate if the flight was not ready.  To be honest I was not expecting the attitude of the staff, the women in charge of the gate was so rude. I reminded her that I am the customer, without me and other customers she would have a job and she just pulled a face.   The conversation continued well until she turned away and took a telephone call, bearing in mind there were four Other members of staff stood next to her, one of whom actually lifted the handset. I have no idea if I have missed my connecting flight because the discussions were going nowher. So as I sit on the runway several hours late I have no idea why, what to do for my connecting flight and extremely disappointed with the service provided by Emirates. Never ever again, well after my return flight that is.  BA from now one thank you."
1138,Flew from JFK - Chennai twice in the last 1.5 months. Food is of good quality. This is an airline owned by the royal family but the flight attendants think they are the royal family!!! Many of the flight attendants are rude and they seem racist to me. They don't serve coffee or alcohol and extra time even when you politely request. I understand its a tough job for them but they could be a bit more pleasant and understand that they are there to serve the customers/passengers. They should learn from the Asian carriers like Singapore air or Cathay Pacific.
1139,"Booked return flights to Dubai for my wife's Christmas present on the 21st December 2014. I was then reminded by my wife that I'd made a silly mistake on the online booking, I had clicked on the wrong flight return date. So I called their customer services today to change the return flight date to the 21st February 2015 (only 4 days after booking) expecting a small admin fee at worst and was shocked to be told there would be a penalty charge of £600 to make the return date amendment (what! its only £800 to cancel the booking). I pointed out to the CS rep that this was really unfair as the change was quick and easy for Emirates. No sympathy what so ever from this individual who seemed to quite enjoy the financial predicament I was now in. Furthermore, this was a business flight so god knows how the economy passengers are treated by Emirates? I reminded him that the terms & conditions on the order confirmation made no reference to change penalty fees (see details below), again he was not interested or even apologetic. Emirates Online Booking Changes    If you make a change to an existing booking online and this results in a refund being due to you from Emirates, then this refund will be provided to you in the form of an Electronic Miscellaneous Document (EMD) Receipt. This EMD Receipt can be used to purchase additional travel or services from Emirates or can be exchanged for a refund at any Emirates office, but is only valid for 1 year from the date of issue and must be used or refunded within that period. This is my first experience of flying with Emirates airline and it will certainly be my last! Stay well clear, their cabins may well be luxurious but their customer service stinks! Back to British Airways for me I'm afraid!"
1140,"I tried to book a flight with the air miles that I had obtained by flying with Emirates only to be told that although there are plenty of seats on the flight I wanted but I was not going to be able to book using my air miles but funny enough I could book a seat if I paid (and they would let me earn more miles I could not use). I asked why this was and I was informed that Emirates in its wisdom, had decided that the journey I wanted to book using my air miles was not available for another 10 days even if it meant I lost miles that I had accumulated.Just goes to show that even loyal Gold class customers get slack treatment by what portrays itself to be an outstanding airline.Poor show Emirates."
1141,"I agree with all of those who thought Emirates were the best of a fairly mediocre lot, only to find they were worse than the low cost airlines on a flight my family and I took to Melbourne via Dubai. Business Class seemed to make no difference and complaints to their Customer Service were met with no apology, I was made to feel like the fact they had messed up ground transport was some how my fault, and the subsequent requests for the address of the Customer Service Director (if there is one) were ignored. Their take-it-or-leave-it attitude to compensation (more air miles- hah as if) and flat refusal to discuss anything has left me with a view that despite my airmiles with them I will NEVER travel with them again and will advise others to try any other airline.  Even without the major issue we experienced, their response to complaints is that they will respond to them in 50 days (so no chance of fixing anything for the return trip), and the service in lounges and on the plane in both business class and economy did nothing to make me think that they were excellent. Yes they introduce themselves to you, but that is the last you see except when they are dumping the mediocre food on you and running away. The A380 is just too big to have one galley at the back of the upper deck, and the crew don't want to give eye contact in case they have to do something and interrupt their flow. Two of the four landings were awful too, so not sure their pilots are much better.  We spent of £10,000 with these folk and they really couldn't care less.  Anyhow, best avoid in my opinion. Good luck if you do decide to travel with them - you will probably be sorry you did."
1142,"Excellent, the food is very good and they bring round plenty of drinks etc. The Hostess's are all lovely, very friendly and helpful.  The seats on the planes are comfortable and the online flight entertainment is good. I am a skinflint and ! went economy class and was very pleased . Couldn't fault the service they offer. No idea why people are moaning. The planes are very clean and the Hostess's look immaculate in the uniforms they wear ."
1143,or no service. It is not nice if you need some informations or helpt. And it is quite expensive.
1144,"A member of staff at Newcastle airport stopped me and my family for carrying our women personal bags. We were charged 100 pounds for carrying our small bag. I am muslim and arab and travel a lot by emirates and always carry my hand bag and my lady's bag and no one ever stopped me and charged me. We were the only ones they forced us to pay. If you doubt the size of my bag, rest assure that was a slim small one with not even space for a perfume. A Chinese member of emirates approved the whole process. I landed in dubai and showed the office there both bags, they were surprized and asked me to complain. I did write them one but of course this airline would only care to market their profits and rewards and ignore its loyal customers complaints and feedback!"
1145,"I traveled with my husband in March 2014 to attend my father in laws funeral it was a last min booking understandable as death doesn't give you a warning, from Australia 2 Greece, long flight , the day of my father and laws passing I had back surgery ( unfortunately ) so I had no choice but to book Buisness glass as we where leaving 2 days after my back surgery for the funeral, the cost was astronomical as it was explained to us, being a last min booking, when we chequed in we where told that if any  of the first class sits where available they will move us, as the cost we payed was almost the same, anyway we boarded the flight, our seats we the last before the bar in the A380 we who're not even seted together my husband is over 6 foot and over 110 kg he had the last seat ( the one that's on its own) a very narrow seat that he had a lot of problems squashing in to, as we took our seats I asked one of the flight attendants if I could please have an extra large pillow from the first class section and I explained I have just had back surgery and the answer was NO sorry there all being used, so I asked if I could get a few smaller once and was told once in the air will see, that never happened, about half way through the flight I asked another flight attendant what the possibility was of moving to a first class seat as the first class was empty and again the reply was I am sorry we can't do that ,my bottle of water was finished and I asked for another one and was very surprised when the flight attendant asked my to pass him the empty bottle so he can refill it for my, as far as the service terrible the food was cold and bland, I thought it must be just a bad flight it can happen sometimes but we had 2 travel back 10 days later and very surprising 2 find the same rudeness unfriendliness and terrible customer service on the way back, the only time things improved where on our way from Dubai to Melbourne there was someone from the airline traveling on the flight judging there performance ( let me tell you) they where all running around and could not be more helpfully in asking can we get u anything mam is everything ok,as before you could ring the bell and no one would appear ( as I explain I had back surgery only a few days earlier and was not very mobile) I had to get up myself a few times just for a coffee or a glass of water as on both flights they ran out of bottled water, I have traveled with Singapore, airlines Quatar airlines Quantas Airlines,Virgin Airlines and most of my trips on Buisness class and I was expecting an amazing experience from all the hipe and good reviews regarding the A380 but I was sooooo disappointed I would never travel with them again at best they reminded me of an airline called jet star that I had the unfortunate pleasure to be on from Hawaii to Melbourne ( in combination with Quantas ) terrible experience and not at all profecional also forgot to mention on two separate occasions they ran out of a perticular selection of food , very hard to except this kind of service when you hear people speak so highly of this airline and when you pay more the $25.000 dollars and you had to pay an extra $100 dollars at the domestic leg of the flight in Greece because no one mentioned that the emirates weight limit did not apply and a lot a lot more that I need days to put in writing thank you once again Stephanie Kotzageridis (flight number 407) Melbourne to Dubai one of several. Very disappointed"
1146,"It seems Emirates customer service representatives are purely drilled in giving apologies, but it's I who's truly sorry! I made the mistake of contacting customer services countless times to try to negotiate with a human being - rather than a robot - and failing.  A company that boasts luxury and first-class treatment, cannot accommodate the needs of the individual, in this case a passenger forced to wait a 7h40m connection whilst being refused Dubai connect services, because of a 20 minute difference. To the normal person, this seems illogical, but to the Emirates representative and their managers, an automated regurgitation of  terms & conditions (by which they are governed), is the most important issue. Fine though, if the airline will not grant me this service, surely there must be something else to compensate for my long and tedious wait in the middle of the night? Nope, nothing. Nothing was offered to me but their 'sincerest' (scripted) apologies. Disappointed does not even begin to cover it! My advice? Don't bother. Save yourself the time and the money, if you're considering calling that is."
1147,"First call took over an hour - costing about £8 - as they endlessly put me on hold, for nothing to come out of it. They were unable to do anything to help, but requested that I call back. When I did, I was connected to a line in India (calling from the UK), and I was similarly placed on hold until they eventually promised to call back - which of course, didn't happen. Third call, PUT ON HOLD AGAIN, and the representative pretended that the line was faulty... I could hear him perfectly fine. With the fourth call, I was given an email address to complain to, and funnily enough, I received no reply but the automated notification. I am appalled at this customer service."
1148,i am  totally overwhelmed by my excellent experience. can't rate them enough. i think they set new bars and standards that other airlines could only wish they could achieve.   I missed my flight and was put on the next flight without charge!
1149,"My wife left her passport on the plane on a flight from Hong Kong of Dubai.  She realized this immediately when we got to the terminal. We informed Emirate of our problem but they refused to allow us back on the plane to retrieve it.  They were absolutely useless and no help at all.  We had to go to the American Consolate inDubai and get a replacement temporary passport. It cost us one night at the airport hotel, my wifes passport, about $450 in cash and her Florida drivers license.  I have tried emailing Emirate many times but have been given the runaround. If they really wanted to communicate with me they have our phone number.  I will never use that airline again nor will I ever refer them to any of my friends."
1150,"I flew from Bangkok to Copenhagen, and had a big frame to transport, which were marked ”Fragile” several times on the package. It was protected by cardboard, bubble wrap and masonite boards. To make sure that it was absolute safe it was all wrapped by 4 roles of duct tape. When we landed, 3 of the 4 corners of the masonite boards were torn off, which would be nearly impossible to do with your bare hands. All of the 4 roles of duct tape had burst and the frame was of course broken. When I complained they told me that I had signed a form which stated that I had full responsibility. I NEVER signed anything and when I asked them to show me the form, they came back after 20 minutes and said they did not have time to find it right now. They said that no matter what the liability rules were on their website.  1) I am not mad about their liability rules. But I think that it is very poor service to completely ruin a package which was packed extremely well and had “Fragile” stickers all over it. 2) And it is very poor service to lie to the costumer about signed forms and not even admit that they forgot to give it to me. 3) And it is at last very poor service not to even apologize for the bad handling of my cargo."
1151,"Booked 4 tickets on Emirates via their partner travel company in LA, but had to cancel within days of making the reservation and 3 weeks prior to the departure due to an unexpected issue. The travel agency started demanding that $450 per ticket in cancellation fees be deposited into their bank account before they would cancel the tickets. The reservation clearly stated a $200 cancellation fees. Forwarded emails and everything else to show what was going on to my credit card company who asked Emirates to determine the dispute case. To our horror, Emirates did not even review the case and instructed the credit card company to reapply the reservation charges to the credit card. They will not answer emails or phone calls. Reopened the dispute... meanwhile the travel agency moved the travel dates 6 months into the future without any authorization from us... yes, they still did not cancel, as originally requested. Anyways, final Emirates response - ""your fault, you booked the tickets with this travel agency"". That was it. No further action against their partner company for over three months of harassment and for demanding direct deposit of the exorbitant cancellation fees instead of deducting it from the credit card transaction as one would expect. Extremely disgusted dealing with these petty thieves. They will take your money happily. But if there is a problem and you need to deal with them, may god save you from their incompetency and insensitivity. Clearly, travel agencies and airlines are pulling such stunts everyday on unsuspecting consumers. I am awaiting a class action lawsuit to share documents and details of my experience. Avoid and save yourselves the headache."
1152,"I booked a business class flight to Melbourne December 2013.,on line and by telephone with their company direct,not an agent. I insisted it needed to be flexible as I was not sure of my return dates.I was told this was possible for a small  admin. fee. I was charged £300 in Melbourne to return to the UK!! I have complained ,but they insist it was mentioned on their booking conditions.I have checked my records,on line and otherwise and I cannot find any mention of this.I have enjoyed their excellent flight services and standards.in the past..but feel very disappointed .Also can they explain why i have had no compensation for a 28 hour delay  over Christmas , We were looked after quite well, but I missed Christmas day with my family in Australia ! Other flight companies compensated their passengers. Why not Emirates?Sidonie11/05/2014 No response or reply from my last letter.  Why is Emirates unable to respond or apologise for the poor service from their administration staff? Their cabin service is excellent,comfortable and caring. What a disgrace! sidonie"
1153,"I think Emirates are okay but if something go wrong, they not care about passengers, no info, no help you have to be on your on.  And they not give you, a new flight as soon as possible, no no they safe the money and book you on a later Emirates. I never try so poor service the worst airline i ever have fly with."
1154,"From check-in to arrival Emirates managed to be consistent in its disappointment. From rude and ignorant ground staff (unfriendly handling of excess baggage, no looks and greetings at the boarding gate) to arrogant flight crew, who prefer to chat amongst each other instead of taking care of the passengers, my first (and definitely last) journey with Emirates was a total disappointment. And that was on Business Class. Someone needs to tell Emirates staff where their salaries come from and what service means. I have been traveling between Asia and Europe on business class for over 20 years and have plenty of opportunities to compare with, but this was the worst experience ever."
1155,I have flown with Emirates a couple of times and found them to be good. their in-flight services are specially commendable. Good Airline to fly with.

1157,"I booked flights from Johannesburg to Thailand in November last year with Emirates. I had booked domestic return flights from Capetown to Jo'burg as we were meeting 4 more people there. flights over were all ok. the flight back from Dubai to Johannesburg was delayed by 1 hour 45 minutes and due to this I missed my connecting flight back to Capetown. myself and my girlfriend had to book into an airport hotel and rebook flights for the following morning. I emailed Emirates to explain that due to their late plane I was out of pocket. they denied it was their fault as I did not book my entire flight through them and offered me some airmiles as a gesture. I replied I wanted my money repaid due to their late plane and received what can only be construed as a fairly polite ""get lost"" apparantly it was unfortunate that I felt the need to email them about my dissapointment again!disgraceful responses from their customer services and no compensation, very dissapointed customer"
1158,"Unspeakably bad. Flying with them was almost literally torture. The seat was broken, dangerous and in every way completely unacceptable. Nobody from Emirates could care less if they put a great deal of effort into their contempt. Flew business class, perched on what amounted to a stool with a lump of wood in the back of my head forcing me to hunch forward. No entertainment whatever. No meal. No drinks. No light. No call button.  After staff insisted I must fill in a complaint form, they would not give me one and directed me to ground staff, who sent me to their office, who told me to try the website. 5 weeks and no response whatever. None! Emirates not only knowingly put me in a dangerous seat, but they have shown utter contempt to me since."
1159,One of the best airlines to fly with. But my travel agent always books me on this airline so I have kindda got bored flying with them. But the airline is great and has worked good for me over the years.
1160,"I tried to write to you through your webpage, but that was limited in characters, so Now I will use this instead. Hi I've experienced something I wasn't thinking should happen with Emirates. I was an idiot meeting one day late for a plane. I mixed up the 00:20 3th february to be a day late, unfortunatly. I accept totally that this is my fault and demands nothing as comfort for my action. When I'm there at the airport, I had been waiting in line and gets the information from one of your employees that I'm late, she is kind enough to start seeking if there is space on the plane this evening. She tells me after a short while that there is an open seat, and I ask if it is all the way to copenhagen, and she says yes, but she has to find out if there is a penalty. She asks me to step aside so she can take other customers while she waits an agreement.  So far so good, information level is good, and she has already seen and understood my interest in getting on that plane, and not staying in Manila airport the night over (the clock is 21-ish).Now when she starts to take other customers, the focus is lost, there comes in a family, while she has another customer, that is unhappy with something, she goes from the customer in the desk, to try to solve the situation. The guy that was beeing helped by your employee gets unsure about the time at last and makes eye contact with another person, and after sometime she comes back and gets the customer through.  Now I'm standing there as the last customer, the line is empty, She has not further informed me, so I go over to the counter again (stood just by the counter) another employee from the airport talks in another language, but I pickup my name and a worrying tone, and something that sounded like ""he is not gonna make it now"".And true enough, she informs me that it is not possible to get on the plane. I ask (i'm very tired) if there is no place on the plane or what the problem was, and she direct me to talk with your office. I ask where the office is, and she directs me losely to the one direction of the airport, and due to I cannot see it I ask confused where exactly it is, and she just say outside and all the way down and on the right. I go in good faith outside but I cannot see anything (its dark) or find the office. I don't know what to do, and I end up taking a cap to town to get a hotel. Now my problem is not with the money or the hotel/extra night I had to stay, it is far more about the false information about that I would get on the plane, and MOST importantly that I did feel neglected in that airport by myself, and no where to go to get help. I would gladly had payed what it would have cost to get on that plane, if somebody would just have directed me or handed me a bill and a boarding pass. locating the offices in Manila airport terminal 1 is not easy!, not when it's dark and not when you are feeling out side of your comfort zone. Now what is the point of this story. It started of with good references of Emirates, I was happy on the way down to Manila, but when I needed you guys the most, you were not there. I know you are getting people from a to b, and you have a customer that is requesting to get to b, and accepts his error and is willing to pay, why does I end up with this bad feeling?The point is this feeling has been unfortunately linked to your brand. The next day I called Thai airways which guided me through the airport, what I should look for, acknowledged it was hard to find the 4th floor in terminal 1, and got me home today. The next time I will chose them (Thai airways) not because of price (it was the same), not due to the product (it had a 9½ hour wait in Bangkok) instead they gave me a secure feeling, which you have failed to give me. When I needed your service, in an unknown place for me, outside my comfort zone, tired and just wanted to get home, you failed getting me to destination B. I know I cannot claim anything, and it is not my interest. I would just inform you that you have lost a customer, and given you competitors an edge with a story that will be told every time people ask me about my trip to the Philippines (Boracay)."
1161,"Emirates used to be good back in 2012, now they have too many customers and money to care about the customer experience.  I took flight from JFK to Bangladesh through Milan then Dubai (8 hours flight each way). It was very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor and it felt like I was in prison with no food and water. Coming back was 39 hours trip which was torturous and I literally felt that a certain percentage of my life was gone. When I press the assistance switch they did not even come for me for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). Their service was so bad that I had to get up and get the water for myself after 90 minutes of waiting. Later on I realized that instead of rotating the stewardess on every transfer (8 hours), Emirates used the same stewardess over again and again. The stewardess were very tired and just stopped responding all together. They just served food and go back to their side. I overheard one of the stewardess complaining about being tired.  I paid over $2,500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats are so closed together that the guy next to me had to place his leg on my side just so he fits in his seat, and I could not even sleep because of that for (8 hours). If I knew that I was going to get in this kind of mess then I would have just taken Ittefaq and save money and time. The only thing good I can say about my trip was the food and entertainment system was good. Flight Information: EK0206 	Fri 20 Dec 13  22:20 	John F Kennedy (JFK)Sat 21 Dec 1322:55 	Dubai (DXB) Return:EK0582 	Sun 22 Dec 13  03:50 	Dubai (DXB)Sun 22 Dec 13  10:05 	Dhaka (DAC)"
1162,"Call Center staff in Manchester, lie about most things to secure the booking, and when we complain it takes a months before they answer, and then its just more lies.... Emirates clearly have a lack of ability to provide a service or interact with customers,  it's hard to think they able to meet other requirements, when they can't get internal issues and information sorted out. We was told at the booking time that Hotel was going to be available because of the 10 hour transit time. LIE We was told that My 15 years old first time alone flyer was going to be accompanied  from check in to exit in Ho Chi Minh City. LIE We was told he would have access to free internet in transit. LIE Under no circumstances had we known the facts, would we have made the booking, !!"
1163,"Emirates business class BKK - SYD .  Pathetic customer service from one flight attendant. Unfortunately, she was the one allocated to our seats.  Pre flight drink served, then wait another 2 hours for meal.  I don't drink wine with my meal, unlike my wife, so I was not even asked what I would like ??? Considering I was drinking beer, a glass of water was not what I was after, but could I get a hold of our flight attendant ......No. 3 hours to be fed on an overnight flight was pretty ordinary, and the quality of the food was likewise.  To be sighed at when pressing the call button was completely unnecessary and made me really feel like I was really inconveniencing their little routine.  I did see other flight attendants asking if there was anything else they could get their passengers as they cleared their table.  My flight attendant grabbed the tray and turned around so quickly as to avoid any chance of eye contact and eliminating the possibility I could request anything.  Shameful customer service and made me wonder what sort of royalty this flight attendant was in a previous life. Emirates probably need to remind her she is not that anymore, and to stop making customers feel that they are a bother to their little routine!!!  PS the flight over to Bankok was just fine, nothing special, was hoping for more for our 20th anniversary, but the BKK to SYD was worse than Jetstar economy !!!  I am 100% confident that if an emirates executive was a secret shopper on this flight! the flight attendant would be terminated at end of flight."
1164,The airline is good but especially commendable is their in-flight services and facilities.
1165,Specifically asked about air mile points at the Airport when checking in and was not told there was a two month time period in which you had to sign up. I then sign up only a couple of days after the allowed time to then be told that all my miles for 2 trips to Mauritius have been lost. Horrendous customer service to go with it!!!
1166,"I've been a member since 2011. I was recommended by a friend who was a skywards member and told me about the benefits. I travel from UK to China 4 to 6 times per year and have used Emirates only and no other airline. I found out today they have not credited me for my first two journeys with them, I wasn't a member at the time but called them once my membership completed and they agreed to backdate the miles. They have said today they don't know anything about it!!  I am not satisfied with this and have lodged a formal complaint. I will also be seeking compensation. I will keep you updated...."
1167,"We've just used Emirates as the flight company for our anniversary holiday. They were absoulutely brilliant and id recommend to anyone!  Compimentary drinks all the way!"
1168,"Lovely cabin crew, Amazing in-flight meal! specially commendable ICE entertainment system."
1169,"Incredible experience with Emirates! Keep Flying with them, from great customer service to precision in everything they do!"
1170,"I have used Emirates extensively in all classes of travel and rarely have they failed to deliver - from the fancy showers and private suites in the first class of an A380 to in-flight-entertainment systems with the most recent and relevant on-demand content. Their lounges - in particular at their Dubai hub - have good selection of food, entertainment and leisure. Loyal customer for six years with more than 100 flights under my belt"
1171,"I'm tall (1.88m) so the seats have to be roomy for me to enjoy them and they were. Very comfortable with plenty of leg room. The in flight entertainment was great, private screen and great movie choice. Food was also good, Emirates will be my choice next time as well."
1172,"I think Emirates is one of the airlines that has set a new bar for on-flight experience. Love the entertainment system with its great selection of movies. The food is great. The service is great. And best of all, they fly almost everywhere. Oh, and great music as you walk into and out of the airplane. I just wish all their airplanes had the new entertainment system installed."
1173,"I use the Dublin-Dubai long haul flight frequently, and I always enjoy flying on Emirates. The planes are comfortable, the flight agreeable, and a great entertainment system."
1174,From Hamburg - Dubai and vice versa.
1175,"While travelling from Dallas to Kolkata Emirates de boarded us on 1st of Dec 12  as flight was over booked and we consented to travel next day and airline gave us denied boarding compensation voucher with assurance that we could travel against this and would get due priority.Now when I wanted to travel in June 13 I face several blackout dates making it impossible to plan a trip.However against payment seats are available on the net. It thus clearly appears that Emirates is giving very low priority to such voucher. When they needed my help I responded but in return reciprocal gesture is missing. Is it not unprofessional or being truly professional? Don't they need to take care of a passenger who cooperated with them?"
1176,"Traveled from Dubai to Atlanta on Feb 11th in EK 221 with my 3 year old daughter. I reserved the tickets on Oct 2012 and selected the seats on emirates.com on the same day. But I was denied my selected seats when I checked in and offered the second last row by the ground staff, with out providing a valid reason. The emirates ground staff at Dubai was very rude and not ready to accept my request, even though My e ticket print out clearly shows my seat selections. I end up spending more than one hour extra at the emigration counter, since I was one of the last passenger to get out from the plane, and it was horrible for me because my 3 year old was sleeping that time.  But the flight crew i was good, they tried to get me a seat in the front, but unfortunately the flight was full, so no luck for me. From now on I will not recommend emirates, if any one is traveling with kids. I feel that emirates is concentrating now only on quantity ( want to have more and more destinations/flights) not on quality  which they used to do before."
1177,"Jeg bestilte billetter til Dubai. Desværre er lørdag i februar samme dato som lørdag i marts, og ved bestillingen fik jeg rykket min hjemrejse til samme dato men måneden efter. Jeg forsøgte at annullerer, for så at bestille igen. men responstiden var så lang at jeg blev utålmodig. Jeg forsøgte så at få Emirates til at ændre hjemrejsedatoen, hvilket lykkes efter lange diskussioner, og et gebyr på 1400 kroner pr. billet.8 dage senere blev mine billetter så annulleret. så nu havde jeg betalt for billetterne, betalt for ændring af hjemrejse,  så blev de annulleret, med et yderligere gebyr, således at hele herligheden kostede mig 6800 kroner og alle billetter var annulleret. Jeg forsøgte at få Emirates til at forstå at fejlen jo var deres, idet deres kundeservice glemte at annullerer at billetterne skulle annulleres. Efter 8 telefonsamtaler, og adskillige mails frem og tilbage med beviser for at jeg faktisk havde bedst om at de ikke skulle annulleres, så ender det hele med at det kan de ikke ændre på. Surt show... et ord  er ikke et ord, og kundeservice er mere kundebesværlig end et serviceorgan. Hold dig fra Emirates hvis ikke du er 100% sikker på at alt kan køres 100% automatisk via EDB. A word is not a word...I ordered tickets to Dubai. Unfortunately, Saturday in February the same date as Saturday in March, when ordering, I moved my return to the same date but the following month. I tried to cancel, and then book again. but the response was so long that I was impatient. I tried to get Emirates to change the return date, which succeeds after long discussions, and a fee of 1400 dollars per. ticket.8 days later my tickets then canceled. So now I had paid for the tickets, paid for amendment of return, so they were canceled, with an additional fee, so that the whole thing cost me 6800 dollars and all tickets were canceled. I tried to get Emirates to understand that the fault was theirs, because their customer service forgot to cancel the tickets were canceled. After 8 phone calls and several emails back and forth with evidence that I actually had the best that they not be canceled, so you end up with it, they can not change. Shit ... a word is not a word, and customer service is more difficult than a customer service organization.Stay away from Emirates if you're not 100% sure that everything can run 100% automatically by computer."
1178,"Flight from  Singapore- Melbourne (EK 0404) 1 Feb 2012During the flight from Singapore to Melbourne, my daughter (4 years old) was injured as a consequence of the negligence of one of flight crew members. My kids asked one of the flight crew members to bring them noodles, so she served them very hot noodles in a plastic cup without inform them (were sitting on the side seats) or us (me and my wife) were sitting in the middle seats, that the noodles were extremely hot and that caution should be taken in opening the cup. As you are no doubt aware, my daughter is only 4 years old and consequently the risk of possible injury was reasonable foreseeable and even probable in the circumstances. When my daughter opened the cup of noodles, she spilt the hot contents on her chest, stomach and bottom. She immediately started to cry and scream feeling the burn. The only treatment that was available on the flight was by way of application of cold towels and ice provided by the crew members. It was apparent to me and my wife that immediate medical treatment was required and therefor we requested the crew to call an Ambulance to be waiting on my daughter’s arrival at Melbourne airport. Upon arrival, my daughter was transported to the Royal Children’s Hospital by Ambulance. At the hospital my daughter received treatment for the burn injuries, which she had sustained. It is presently unclear as to how long it will take for these injuries to fully heal and furthermore it is presently uncertain as to whether permanent scarring will be a result of the incident described herein. We have been left traumatised and anxious since this incident. My daughter continues to have nightmares and sleep difficulties since that happened and I have a psychologist report shows that she suffered from that accident.  I have an official medical report also from Royal Melbourne hospital and some photograph that had taken by the hospital photographer. After all what happened they didn't apologize, they didn't even call to check and asked how my daughter condition, and even the treatment costs I've been taking care of it B W"
1179,"Were going from Hamburg to Manila and experienced a perfect flight. Low price, distinguished service in the plane and empathetic staff. Not much to say - 5 stars from here."
1180,amazing airline I flew with them to New Zealand from Scotland and it was great! Comfy and the staff were so friendly will us them again and again!! Highly recommended.
1181,"First overseas trip & we chose Emirates for the extra leg room & renowned service. Very memorable trip, staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Seats were spacious & comfortable. Highly recommend flying with them - economy exceeded my expectation."
1182,From start of flight to destination you get 100% customer satisfaction.
1183,"Staff onboard just excellent nothing too much trouble and with a smile!!.Food good and well prsented. Really felt like a supper in the sky with nice wines and bar service.Cleanliness of WC's was 10/10 throughout the flight.Delay on connection and offered an upgrade without evening thinking about it.My new preference in flying East."
1184,"how the air staff managed is a miracleto aussie wowfrom aussie to dubie wowfrom dubia to birmingham and mancherster with some of the passengers no thanks"
1185,"Having worked in the Oilfield I have flown with most of the major carriers all over the world. Now I'm working in the dive industry and I travel quite frequently as well with most of my trips being between Egypt and South Africa. Based on my last two long haul flights, the service and professionalism of Emirates staff has topped any other Airline I have ever flown with and I now make a point of booking with Emirates even when a cheaper carrier is sometimes available. Admittedly I have has some issues with call centre staff but nothing to put me off. I'm flying from Egypt to South Africa again in 5 days and I'm actually looking forward to the trip rather than dreading it (as I used to in the past), which I consider as a great indicator of the quality Emirates delivers. I hope this quality continues and with my travel destinations expanding this next year I hope Emirates carries me to most of them!"
1186,Just turned into a gold member and have always had great experiences of their service. Recently travelled their a380 service.... Fantastic.
1187,"I did a price quote for a ticket but then when I further realised that other sites were cheaper than Emirates, selling Emirates tickets, I was very disappointed, are they intentionally trying to dive customers away from themselves?"
1188,The help line was fantastic in helping us book a flight - highly recommended
1189,"Try ur journey in Emirates as their Skywards member and feel urself the gesture of Dubai... Emirates.. my all time favourite...."
1190,"Booked our holiday of a lifetime with the first step of booking business class flights to NZ with stopovers in Thailand & Australia and Dubai we were picked up at our doorstep by them and same service in the country's we visited with the exception of Thailand and also brought home on return to UK  the airport lounges and their content are of the highest standard the flights mainly on the A380 was a holiday in itself with the staff getting the mix of not being too formal but very friendly perfect I felt I was with good friends/family etc.To sum it up when I returned to home in UK and was asked by a friend what was highlight of such a wonderful holiday I paused and thought for a while and replied THE FLYING."
1191,"I Had the good fortune to go visit my sister in Brisbane recently,andas i stay in Glasgow,the thought of having to go through heathrowto go to Australia was pretty daunting. But after a few checks on the internet I found that Emirates fly directto Australia from Glasgow,what a result although you do have to gothrough their hub at Dubai,but the chance to stretch your legs isalways welcome. But although i was travelling in what the Americans call coach classI thought the level of service and attention to detail was superb,thefood was good for airline food anyway,the ice entertainment systemwas top drawer,and the cabin staff very helfull. I know now that the next time i go to see my sister i will definatleygo with Emirates Airlines."
1192,"used to be one of the best, but long since overhauled by Etihad and Qatar"
1193,"Quick and easy booking, will arrange many visas for you over the phone eg Australia. Pre flight seat booking days before and online check in 24 hours before. Many varied diets available. Facilities in Economy class match many of those found in Business class on other airlines...trusted and well loved airline."
1194,we use for all our long haul to Dubai the extra leg room is a bonus but the service is what counts book in and flight crews always ready to help and have a smile on there faces
1195,"realaxing, big and recomendable"
1196,"It is new airplanes they have ,so much space and the food is very good with 2 choises and drinks free. Really excelent service both on the plane and before !! Keep on the good work !!"
1197,A flight experience like no other. From start to finish the best flights I've ever been on. I would highly recommend them and often do.
1198,"Flown twice with Emirates, both return flights - Manchester to Perth via Dubai. On both occasions our family of two adults and two children were impressed by the level of service, quality of food and the wide choice offered by the in-flight ICE entertainment system. We will be flying with Emirates again when we make our permanent move to Oz in the very near future!"
1199,"I loved the interior design and the star spangled ceilings. Food was good and there was enough leg space. The customer service on Lufthansa is better, though."
1200,"I love emirates air, specially the big airline cerrier, they have tons of movies and the best of service in the air."
1201,"I fly many airlines.However. I found the girls rather rude on a flight to Bangkok.Also leg room was bad.Will only use them if I have to.However the management side in Malta were very professional and very good."
1202,"Excellent service, comfortable flight, polite helpful cabin crew"
1203,"Emirates is an airline which stands out from others. Their long haul and short haul flights have excellent facilities, entertainment and service. I have travelled with them many times and each time had a great experience. Competition is tightening up in the industry and they have to start keeping up with Qatar airways. A380 is an amazing flight with two decks. First class and business class facilities are amazing and the economy is not bad at all. Extra legroom and better entertainment system (ICE) serves you well.  First change (unless you are travelling on a specially discounted ticket) is free and chargable after that. This has come in handy couple of times but I should mention that airline is very accomadating. Wish most of the airlines provided similar service."
1204,"Not long back from Dubai and had a great economy flight with Emirates.  From check-in on-line to bag drop off to boarding it was all so smooth in each direction.  The in-flight entertainment is unmatched in choice compared with many other international carriers that I've flown with and the food, drinks and service is top quality.  Ground staff in dubai were brilliant and very friendly"
1205,"Recently took a world tour New Zealand, Australia and Thailand on Emirates - fantastic airline will always fly Emirates."
1206,"Great service, the food is better than other airlines and this is not an airline where you have to pay extra to breathe! I wish all airlines were like emirates!"
1207,"I recently completed a return flight from London to Cape Town via Dubai with Emirates.Although I did treat myself to business class, I must say the flights I had, (four in all) were great.Staff very friendly and helpful, from the ground staff to the air crew,.I had a nice relaxing flight, fantastic food , and the entertainment on offer was second to none.  Will definitely use again, although it will be in economy, but from what other passengers have said I know the flight will be just as good"
1208,Had a fantastic flight and service to Dubai
1209,"Fast Check-in, comfort, flight attendants, food and entertainment 5 stars across the board. Definitely the best airline that I have flown on."
1210,"We travelled with them to Australia this year - it was a great flight, great entertainment but disappointed with the service from the staff. When the staff were bringing food and drinks the front staff in our area  finished the row ahead of us and the back staff finished row behind us so our row didn't always get the chance to have extra drinks.  After one lunch break I asked for a 2nd cup of coffee like many others did - we were only row not to get it.  One staff member put his hand up probably because he wasn't serving coffee and walked on by and so I asked the next one who walked by and she said she would bring it in a minute but it didn't come. I then asked again and someone else said they had stopped serving and I would have to wait and they would serve it to me later but they never did and I never asked them because it seemed it was too much trouble for them.  I never had this problem with Singapore Airlines."
1211,"Travelled with them before, lovely in flight food and great services. I am flying with them again in September 2011. Good in flight entertainment with many flims to chose from . Very good experience."
